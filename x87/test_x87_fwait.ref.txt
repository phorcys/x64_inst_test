=== Testing FWAIT instruction ===

Test 1: Basic synchronization
Control word without FWAIT: 0x0000
Control word with FWAIT: 0x0000
[TEST] Control words match                      PASS

Test 2: Exception state
Status with FWAIT: 0x3804
Status without FWAIT: 0x3004
[TEST] Exception states match                   PASS

Test 3: Multiple FWAITs
Control word with double FWAIT: 0x0000
Control word without FWAIT: 0x0000
[TEST] Multiple FWAITs work correctly           PASS

==== Testing FWAIT vs FNOP ====
Initial state:
Tag Word:     0x0000
Top: 0
C0: 0, C1: 0, C2: 0, C3: 0

After FWAIT:
Tag Word:     0x0000
Top: 0
C0: 0, C1: 0, C2: 0, C3: 0

After FNOP:
Tag Word:     0x0000
Top: 0
C0: 0, C1: 0, C2: 0, C3: 0
[TEST] FWAIT vs FNOP control word               PASS
[TEST] FWAIT vs FNOP status word                PASS
[TEST] FWAIT vs FNOP tag word                   PASS

==== Testing FWAIT with Modern CPU Features ====

-- Test 1: With SSE --
MXCSR before: 0x00001F80
MXCSR after:  0x00001F80
[TEST] MXCSR unchanged with FWAIT               PASS

-- Test 2: With AVX --
XCR0 before: 0x00000000000000FF
XCR0 after:  0x00000000000000FF
[TEST] XCR0 unchanged with FWAIT                PASS

==== Testing FWAIT Status Effects ====

Test 1: All exceptions masked
Status after FWAIT: 0x0000
[TEST] Status word matches expected             PASS

Test 2: All exceptions unmasked
Status after FWAIT: 0x0000
[TEST] Status word matches expected             PASS

Test 3: Partial exceptions masked
Status after FWAIT: 0x0000
[TEST] Status word matches expected             PASS

Test 4: Extended precision
Status after FWAIT: 0x0000
[TEST] Status word matches expected             FAIL
  [FAIL DETAIL] x87/test_x87_fwait.c:257

Test 5: Single precision
Status after FWAIT: 0x0000
[TEST] Status word matches expected             PASS

==== Testing FWAIT Combinations ====

Test 1: All exceptions masked
Status after FWAIT: 0x0000
[TEST] No unexpected exceptions                 PASS

Test 2: All exceptions unmasked
Status after FWAIT: 0x0000
[TEST] No unexpected exceptions                 PASS

Test 3: Partial exceptions masked
Status after FWAIT: 0x0000
[TEST] No unexpected exceptions                 PASS

Test 4: Different rounding modes
Status after FWAIT: 0x0000
[TEST] No unexpected exceptions                 PASS

Test 5: Different precision modes
Status after FWAIT: 0x0000
[TEST] No unexpected exceptions                 PASS

==== Extended FWAIT Tests ====
Before exception:
Tag Word:     0x0000
Top: 0
C0: 0, C1: 0, C2: 0, C3: 0

After exception with FWAIT:
Tag Word:     0x3804
Top: 7
C0: 0, C1: 0, C2: 0, C3: 0
[TEST] Divide by zero flag set                  PASS
