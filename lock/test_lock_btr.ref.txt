=== Testing LOCK BTR instruction ===

Testing LOCK BTR with different operand sizes:
BYTE: 0x55 with bit 3 reset = 0x55
WORD: 0x5555 with bit 7 reset = 0x5555
DWORD: 0x55555555 with bit 15 reset = 0x55555555
QWORD: 0x5555555555555555 with bit 31 reset = 0x5555555555555555

Testing LOCK BTR with different addressing modes:
REG->MEM: 0x12345678 with bit 7 reset = 0x12345678
IMM->MEM: 0x12345678 with bit 15 reset = 0x12345678

Testing LOCK BTR in multithreaded environment:
Initial value: 1
Final value: 0 (expected: 0)
