=== Testing LOCK BTS instruction ===

Testing LOCK BTS with different operand sizes:
BYTE: 0x55 with bit 3 set = 0x5D
WORD: 0x5555 with bit 7 set = 0x55D5
DWORD: 0x55555555 with bit 15 set = 0x5555D555
QWORD: 0x5555555555555555 with bit 31 set = 0x55555555D5555555

Testing LOCK BTS with different addressing modes:
REG->MEM: 0x12345678 with bit 7 set = 0x123456F8
IMM->MEM: 0x12345678 with bit 15 set = 0x1234D678

Testing LOCK BTS in multithreaded environment:
Initial value: 0
Final value: 1 (expected: 1)
