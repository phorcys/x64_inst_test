=== Testing PADDUSW instruction ===
Test 1:
  [0] 0x0000 + 0x0000 = 0x0000 (expected 0x0000) - PASS
  [1] 0x0001 + 0x0001 = 0x0002 (expected 0x0002) - PASS
  [2] 0x7FFF + 0x0001 = 0x8000 (expected 0x8000) - PASS
  [3] 0x8000 + 0x7FFF = 0xFFFF (expected 0xFFFF) - PASS
Test 2:
  [0] 0xFFFF + 0x0001 = 0xFFFF (expected 0xFFFF) - PASS
  [1] 0xFFFF + 0xFFFF = 0xFFFF (expected 0xFFFF) - PASS
  [2] 0xFFFF + 0x8000 = 0xFFFF (expected 0xFFFF) - PASS
  [3] 0xFFFF + 0x7FFF = 0xFFFF (expected 0xFFFF) - PASS
Test 3:
  [0] 0x8000 + 0x7FFF = 0xFFFF (expected 0xFFFF) - PASS
