Description ¶

The AESENCWIDE256KL^1 instruction performs 14 rounds of AES to encrypt each of the eight blocks in XMM0-7 using the 256-bit key indicated by the handle from the second operand. It replaces each input block in XMM0-7 with its corresponding encrypted block
if the operation succeeds (e.g., does not run into a handle violation failure).
