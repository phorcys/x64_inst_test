Description ¶

Push one of seven commonly used constants (in double extended-precision floating-point format) onto the FPU register stack. The constants that can be loaded with these instructions include +1.0, +0.0, log[2]10, log[2]e, π, log[10]2, and log[e]2. For each
constant, an internal 66-bit constant is rounded (as specified by the RC field in the FPU control word) to double extended-precision floating-point format. The inexact-result exception (#P) is not generated as a result of the rounding, nor is the C1 flag
set in the x87 FPU status word if the value is rounded up.

See the section titled “Approximation of Pi” in Chapter 8 of the Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for a description of the π constant.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.

IA-32 Architecture Compatibility ¶

When the RC field is set to round-to-nearest, the FPU produces the same constants that is produced by the Intel 8087 and Intel 287 math coprocessors.
