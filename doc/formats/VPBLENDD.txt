Description ¶

Dword elements from the source operand (second operand) are conditionally written to the destination operand (first operand) depending on bits in the immediate operand (third operand). The immediate bits (bits 7:0) form a mask that determines whether the
corresponding dword in the destination is copied from the source. If a bit in the mask, corresponding to a dword, is “1", then the dword is copied, else the dword is unchanged.

VEX.128 encoded version: The second source operand can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The first source and destination operands are XMM registers. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM register are zeroed.

VEX.256 encoded version: The first source operand is a YMM register. The second source operand is a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. The destination operand is a YMM register.
