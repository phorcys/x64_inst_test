Description ¶

Converts one SIMD register of packed single data into a single register of packed BF16 data.

This instruction uses “Round to nearest (even)” rounding mode. Output denormals are always flushed to zero and input denormals are always treated as zero. MXCSR is not consulted nor updated.

As the instruction operand encoding table shows, the EVEX.vvvv field is not used for encoding an operand. EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 0b1111 otherwise instructions will #UD.
