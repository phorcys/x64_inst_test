Description ¶

Computes the reciprocal square root of the float64 values in the source operand (the second operand) and store the results to the destination operand (the first operand). The approximate reciprocal is evaluated with less than 2^-28 of maximum relative
error.

If any source element is NaN, the quietized NaN source value is returned for that element. Negative (non-zero) source numbers, as well as -∞, return the canonical NaN and set the Invalid Flag (#I).

A value of -0 must return -∞ and set the DivByZero flags (#Z). Negative numbers should return NaN and set the Invalid flag (#I). Note however that the instruction flush input denormals to zero of the same sign, so negative denormals return -∞ and set the
DivByZero flag.

The source operand is a ZMM register, a 512-bit memory location or a 512-bit vector broadcasted from a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is a ZMM register, conditionally updated using writemask k1.

EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.
