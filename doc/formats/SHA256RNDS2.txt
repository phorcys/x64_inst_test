Description ¶

The SHA256RNDS2 instruction performs 2 rounds of SHA256 operation using an initial SHA256 state (C,D,G,H) from the first operand, an initial SHA256 state (A,B,E,F) from the second operand, and a pre-computed sum of the next 2 round message dwords and the
corresponding round constants from the implicit operand xmm0. Note that only the two lower dwords of XMM0 are used by the instruction.

The updated SHA256 state (A,B,E,F) is written to the first operand, and the second operand can be used as the updated state (C,D,G,H) in later rounds.
