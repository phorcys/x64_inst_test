FBLD — Load Binary Coded Decimal

Opcode Instruction 64-Bit Mode Compat/Leg Mode                            Description
DF /4  FBLD m80bcd Valid       Valid           Convert BCD value to floating-point and push onto the FPU stack.

Description ¶

Converts the BCD source operand into double extended-precision floating-point format and pushes the value onto the FPU stack. The source operand is loaded without rounding errors. The sign of the source operand is preserved, including that of −0.

The packed BCD digits are assumed to be in the range 0 through 9; the instruction does not check for invalid digits (AH through FH). Attempting to load an invalid encoding produces an undefined result.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.
