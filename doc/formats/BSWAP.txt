Description ¶

Reverses the byte order of a 32-bit or 64-bit (destination) register. This instruction is provided for converting little-endian values to big-endian format and vice versa. To swap bytes in a word value (16-bit register), use the XCHG instruction. When
the BSWAP instruction references a 16-bit register, the result is undefined.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at
the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.

IA-32 Architecture Legacy Compatibility ¶

The BSWAP instruction is not supported on IA-32 processors earlier than the Intel486TM processor family. For compatibility with this instruction, software should include functionally equivalent code for execution on Intel processors earlier than the
Intel486 processor family.
