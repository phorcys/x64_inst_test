EADD — Add a Page to an Uninitialized Enclave

 Opcode/Instruction   Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                         Description
EAX = 01H ENCLS[EADD] IR    V/V                    SGX1               This leaf function adds a page to an uninitialized enclave.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En EAX       RBX                         RCX
IR    EADD (In) Address of a PAGEINFO (In)  Address of the destination EPC page (In)

Description ¶

This leaf function copies a source page from non-enclave memory into the EPC, associates the EPC page with an SECS page residing in the EPC, and stores the linear address and security attributes in EPCM. As part of the association, the enclave offset and
the security attributes are measured and extended into the SECS.MRENCLAVE. This instruction can only be executed when current privilege level is 0.

RBX contains the effective address of a PAGEINFO structure while RCX contains the effective address of an EPC page. The table below provides additional information on the memory parameter of EADD leaf function.

EADD Memory Parameter Semantics ¶

PAGEINFO                             PAGEINFO.SECS                           PAGEINFO.SRCPGE                      PAGEINFO.SECINFO                     EPCPAGE
Read access permitted by Non Enclave Read/Write access permitted by Enclave  Read access permitted by Non Enclave Read access permitted by Non Enclave Write access permitted by Enclave

The instruction faults if any of the following:

EADD Faulting Conditions ¶

The operands are not properly aligned.    Unsupported security attributes are set.
Refers to an invalid SECS.                Reference is made to an SECS that is locked by another thread.
The EPC page is locked by another thread. RCX does not contain an effective address of an EPC page.
The EPC page is already valid.            If security attributes specifies a TCS and the source page specifies unsupported TCS values or fields.
The SECS has been initialized.            The specified enclave offset is outside of the enclave address space.
