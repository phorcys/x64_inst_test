Description ¶

This instruction performs a SIMD compare of the packed FP16 values in the first source operand and the second source operand and returns the maximum value for each pair of values to the destination operand.

If the values being compared are both 0.0s (of either sign), the value in the second operand (source operand) is returned. If a value in the second operand is an SNaN, then SNaN is forwarded unchanged to the destination (that is, a QNaN version of the
SNaN is not returned).

If only one value is a NaN (SNaN or QNaN) for this instruction, the second operand (source operand), either a NaN or a valid floating-point value, is written to the result. If instead of this behavior, it is required that the NaN source operand (from
either the first or second operand) be returned, the action of VMAXPH can be emulated using a sequence of instructions, such as, a comparison followed by AND, ANDN and OR.

EVEX encoded versions: The first source operand (the second operand) is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register. The second source operand can be a ZMM/YMM/XMM register, a 512/256/128-bit memory location or a 512/256/128-bit vector broadcast from a 16-bit memory
location. The destination operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register conditionally updated with writemask k1.
