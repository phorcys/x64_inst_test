Description ¶

Computes the approximate base-2 exponential evaluation of the single-precision floating-point values in the source operand (the second operand) and store the results in the destination operand (the first operand) using the write-mask k1. The approximate
base-2 exponential is evaluated with less than 2^-23 of relative error.

Denormal input values are treated as zeros and do not signal #DE, irrespective of MXCSR.DAZ. Denormal results are flushed to zeros and do not signal #UE, irrespective of MXCSR.FTZ.

The source operand is a ZMM register, a 512-bit memory location, or a 512-bit vector broadcasted from a 32-bit memory location. The destination operand is a ZMM register, conditionally updated using writemask k1.

EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.
