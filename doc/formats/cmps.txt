Description ¶

Compares the byte, word, doubleword, or quadword specified with the first source operand with the byte, word, doubleword, or quadword specified with the second source operand and sets the status flags in the EFLAGS register according to the results.

Both source operands are located in memory. The address of the first source operand is read from DS:SI, DS:ESI or RSI (depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction is 16, 32, or 64, respectively). The address of the second source operand is
read from ES:DI, ES:EDI or RDI (again depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction is 16, 32, or 64). The DS segment may be overridden with a segment override prefix, but the ES segment cannot be overridden.

At the assembly-code level, two forms of this instruction are allowed: the “explicit-operands” form and the “no-operands” form. The explicit-operands form (specified with the CMPS mnemonic) allows the two source operands to be specified explicitly. Here,
the source operands should be symbols that indicate the size and location of the source values. This explicit-operand form is provided to allow documentation. However, note that the documentation provided by this form can be misleading. That is, the
source operand symbols must specify the correct type (size) of the operands (bytes, words, or doublewords, quadwords), but they do not have to specify the correct loca-

tion. Locations of the source operands are always specified by the DS:(E)SI (or RSI) and ES:(E)DI (or RDI) registers, which must be loaded correctly before the compare string instruction is executed.

The no-operands form provides “short forms” of the byte, word, and doubleword versions of the CMPS instructions. Here also the DS:(E)SI (or RSI) and ES:(E)DI (or RDI) registers are assumed by the processor to specify the location of the source operands.
The size of the source operands is selected with the mnemonic: CMPSB (byte comparison), CMPSW (word comparison), CMPSD (doubleword comparison), or CMPSQ (quadword comparison using REX.W).

After the comparison, the (E/R)SI and (E/R)DI registers increment or decrement automatically according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS register. (If the DF flag is 0, the (E/R)SI and (E/R)DI register increment; if the DF flag is 1, the
registers decrement.) The registers increment or decrement by 1 for byte operations, by 2 for word operations, 4 for doubleword operations. If operand size is 64, RSI and RDI registers increment by 8 for quadword operations.

The CMPS, CMPSB, CMPSW, CMPSD, and CMPSQ instructions can be preceded by the REP prefix for block comparisons. More often, however, these instructions will be used in a LOOP construct that takes some action based on the setting of the status flags before
the next comparison is made. See “REP/REPE/REPZ /REPNE/REPNZ—Repeat String Operation Prefix” in Chapter 4 of the Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2B, for a description of the REP prefix.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default address size is 64 bits, 32 bit address size is supported using the prefix 67H. Use of the REX.W prefix promotes doubleword operation to 64 bits (see CMPSQ). See the summary chart at the beginning of this section
for encoding data and limits.
