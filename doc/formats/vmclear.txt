VMCLEAR — Clear Virtual-Machine Control Structure

Description ¶

This instruction applies to the VMCS whose VMCS region resides at the physical address contained in the instruction operand. The instruction ensures that VMCS data for that VMCS (some of these data may be currently maintained on the processor) are copied
to the VMCS region in memory. It also initializes parts of the VMCS region (for example, it sets the launch state of that VMCS to clear). See Chapter 25, “Virtual Machine Control Structures.”

The operand of this instruction is always 64 bits and is always in memory. If the operand is the current-VMCS pointer, then that pointer is made invalid (set to FFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFFH).

Note that the VMCLEAR instruction might not explicitly write any VMCS data to memory; the data may be already resident in memory before the VMCLEAR is executed.
