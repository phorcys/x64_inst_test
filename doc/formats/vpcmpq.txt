Description ¶

Performs a SIMD compare of the packed integer values in the second source operand and the first source operand and returns the results of the comparison to the mask destination operand. The comparison predicate operand (immediate byte) specifies the type
of comparison performed on each pair of packed values in the two source operands. The result of each comparison is a single mask bit result of 1 (comparison true) or 0 (comparison false).

VPCMPQ/VPCMPUQ performs a comparison between pairs of signed/unsigned quadword integer values.

The first source operand (second operand) is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register. The second source operand can be a ZMM/YMM/XMM register or a 512/256/128-bit memory location or a 512-bit vector broadcasted from a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand
(first operand) is a mask register k1. Up to 8/4/2 comparisons are performed with results written to the destination operand under the writemask k2.

The comparison predicate operand is an 8-bit immediate: bits 2:0 define the type of comparison to be performed. Bits 3 through 7 of the immediate are reserved. Compiler can implement the pseudo-op mnemonic listed in Table 5-21.
