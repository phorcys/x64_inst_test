Description ¶

Restores SSP from the shadow-stack-restore token pointed to by m64. If the SSP restore was successful then the instruction replaces the shadow-stack-restore token with a previous-ssp token. The instruction sets the CF flag to indicate whether the SSP
address recorded in the shadow-stack-restore token that was processed was 4 byte aligned, i.e., whether an alignment hole was created when the restore-shadow-stack token was pushed on this shadow stack.

Following RSTORSSP if a restore-shadow-stack token needs to be saved on the previous shadow stack, use the SAVEPREVSSP instruction.

If pushing a restore-shadow-stack token on the previous shadow stack is not required, the previous-ssp token can be popped using the INCSSPQ instruction. If the CF flag was set to indicate presence of an alignment hole, an additional INCSSPD instruction
is needed to advance the SSP past the alignment hole.
