Description ¶

This instruction performs no operation. It is a one-byte or multi-byte NOP that takes up space in the instruction stream but does not impact machine context, except for the EIP register.

The multi-byte form of NOP is available on processors with model encoding:

  • CPUID.01H.EAX[Bytes 11:8] = 0110B or 1111B

The multi-byte NOP instruction does not alter the content of a register and will not issue a memory operation. The instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.
