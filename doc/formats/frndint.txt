FRNDINT — Round to Integer

Opcode  Mode Leg Mode          Description
D9 FC                  Round ST(0) to an integer.

Description ¶

Rounds the source value in the ST(0) register to the nearest integral value, depending on the current rounding mode (setting of the RC field of the FPU control word), and stores the result in ST(0).

If the source value is ∞, the value is not changed. If the source value is not an integral value, the floating-point inexact-result exception (#P) is generated.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.
