Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En Tuple     Operand 1       Operand 2     Operand 3   Operand 4
A     N/A   ModRM:reg (r, w)  VEX.vvvv (r)  ModRM:r/m (r) N/A
B     Full  ModRM:reg (r, w)  EVEX.vvvv (r) ModRM:r/m (r) N/A

Description ¶

Multiplies the individual signed words of the first source operand by the corresponding signed words of the second source operand, producing intermediate signed, doubleword results. The adjacent doubleword results are then summed and accumulated in the
destination operand. If the intermediate sum overflows a 32b signed number, the result is saturated to either 0x7FFF_FFFF for positive numbers of 0x8000_0000 for negative numbers.

This instruction supports memory fault suppression.
