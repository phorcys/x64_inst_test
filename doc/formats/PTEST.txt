Description ¶

PTEST and VPTEST set the ZF flag if all bits in the result are 0 of the bitwise AND of the first source operand (first operand) and the second source operand (second operand). VPTEST sets the CF flag if all bits in the result are 0 of the bitwise AND of
the second source operand (second operand) and the logical NOT of the destination operand.

The first source register is specified by the ModR/M reg field.

128-bit versions: The first source register is an XMM register. The second source register can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The destination register is not modified.

VEX.256 encoded version: The first source register is a YMM register. The second source register can be a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. The destination register is not modified.

Note: In VEX-encoded versions, VEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD.
