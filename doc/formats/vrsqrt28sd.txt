Description ¶

Computes the reciprocal square root of the low float64 value in the second source operand (the third operand) and store the result to the destination operand (the first operand). The approximate reciprocal square root is evaluated with less than 2^-28 of
maximum relative error. The result is written into the low float64 element of xmm1 according to the writemask k1. Bits 127:64 of the destination is copied from the corresponding bits of the first source operand (the second operand).

If any source element is NaN, the quietized NaN source value is returned for that element. Negative (non-zero) source numbers, as well as -∞, return the canonical NaN and set the Invalid Flag (#I).

A value of -0 must return -∞ and set the DivByZero flags (#Z). Negative numbers should return NaN and set the Invalid flag (#I). Note however that the instruction flush input denormals to zero of the same sign, so negative denormals return -∞ and set the
DivByZero flag.

The first source operand is an XMM register. The second source operand is an XMM register or a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is a XMM register.
