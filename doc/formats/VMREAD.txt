VMREAD — Read Field from Virtual-Machine Control Structure

    Opcode/Instruction      Op/En                     Description
NP 0F 78 VMREAD r/m64, r64  MR    Reads a specified VMCS field (in 64-bit mode).
NP 0F 78 VMREAD r/m32, r32  MR    Reads a specified VMCS field (outside 64-bit mode).

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Description ¶

Reads a specified field from a VMCS and stores it into a specified destination operand (register or memory). In VMX root operation, the instruction reads from the current VMCS. If executed in VMX non-root operation, the instruction reads from the VMCS
referenced by the VMCS link pointer field in the current VMCS.

The VMCS field is specified by the VMCS-field encoding contained in the register source operand. Outside IA-32e mode, the source operand has 32 bits, regardless of the value of CS.D. In 64-bit mode, the source operand has 64 bits.

The effective size of the destination operand, which may be a register or in memory, is always 32 bits outside IA-32e mode (the setting of CS.D is ignored with respect to operand size) and 64 bits in 64-bit mode. If the VMCS field specified by the source
operand is shorter than this effective operand size, the high bits of the destination operand are cleared to 0. If the VMCS field is longer, then the high bits of the field are not read.

Note that any faults resulting from accessing a memory destination operand can occur only after determining, in the operation section below, that the relevant VMCS pointer is valid and that the specified VMCS field is supported.
