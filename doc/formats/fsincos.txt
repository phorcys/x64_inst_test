FSINCOS — Sine and Cosine

Opcode Instruction 64-Bit Mode Compat/Leg Mode                                                               Description
D9 FB  FSINCOS     Valid       Valid           Compute the sine and cosine of ST(0); replace ST(0) with the approximate sine, and push the approximate cosine onto the register stack.

Description ¶

Computes both the approximate sine and the cosine of the source operand in register ST(0), stores the sine in ST(0), and pushes the cosine onto the top of the FPU register stack. (This instruction is faster than executing the FSIN and FCOS instructions
in succession.)

The source operand must be given in radians and must be within the range −2^63 to +2^63. The following table shows the results obtained when taking the sine and cosine of various classes of numbers, assuming that underflow does not occur.

If the source operand is outside the acceptable range, the C2 flag in the FPU status word is set, and the value in register ST(0) remains unchanged. The instruction does not raise an exception when the source operand is out of range. It is up to the
program to check the C2 flag for out-of-range conditions. Source values outside the range − 2^63 to +2^63 can be reduced to the range of the instruction by subtracting an appropriate integer multiple of 2π. However, even within the range -2^63 to +2^63,
inaccurate results can occur because the finite approximation of π used internally for argument reduction is not sufficient in all cases. Therefore, for accurate results it is safe to apply FSINCOS only to arguments reduced accurately in software, to a
value smaller in absolute value than 3π/8. See the sections titled “Approximation of Pi” and “Transcendental Instruction Accuracy” in Chapter 8 of the Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for a discussion of the
proper value to use for π in performing such reductions.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.
