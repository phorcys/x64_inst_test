Description ¶

Loads a hardware generated random value and store it in the destination register. The size of the random value is determined by the destination register size and operating mode. The Carry Flag indicates whether a random value is available at the time the
instruction is executed. CF=1 indicates that the data in the destination is valid. Otherwise CF=0 and the data in the destination operand will be returned as zeros for the specified width. All other flags are forced to 0 in either situation. Software
must check the state of CF=1 for determining if a valid random value has been returned, otherwise it is expected to loop and retry execution of RDRAND (see Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, Section 7.3.17, “Random
Number Generator Instructions”).

This instruction is available at all privilege levels.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operand size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.B permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bit operands. See the summary
chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.
