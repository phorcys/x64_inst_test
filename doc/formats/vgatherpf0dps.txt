Description ¶

The instruction conditionally prefetches up to sixteen 32-bit or eight 64-bit integer byte data elements. The elements are specified via the VSIB (i.e., the index register is an zmm, holding packed indices). Elements will only be prefetched if their
corresponding mask bit is one.

Lines prefetched are loaded into to a location in the cache hierarchy specified by a locality hint (T0):

  • T0 (temporal data)—prefetch data into the first level cache.

[PS data] For dword indices, the instruction will prefetch sixteen memory locations. For qword indices, the instruction will prefetch eight values.

[PD data] For dword and qword indices, the instruction will prefetch eight memory locations.

Note that:

(1) The prefetches may happen in any order (or not at all). The instruction is a hint.

(2) The mask is left unchanged.

(3) Not valid with 16-bit effective addresses. Will deliver a #UD fault.

(4) No FP nor memory faults may be produced by this instruction.

(5) Prefetches do not handle cache line splits

(6) A #UD is signaled if the memory operand is encoded without the SIB byte.
