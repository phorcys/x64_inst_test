    1. Software should ensure VCVTSD2SI is encoded with VEX.L=0. Encoding VCVTSD2SI with VEX.L=1 may encounter unpredictable behavior across different processor generations.

    2. VEX.W1/EVEX.W1 in non-64 bit is ignored; the instructions behaves as if the W0 version is used.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En  Tuple Type    Operand 1      Operand 2    Operand 3 Operand 4
A     N/A          ModRM:reg (w)  ModRM:r/m (r)  N/A       N/A
B     Tuple1 Fixed ModRM:reg (w)  ModRM:r/m (r)  N/A       N/A

Description ¶

Converts a double precision floating-point value in the source operand (the second operand) to a signed double-word integer in the destination operand (first operand). The source operand can be an XMM register or a 64-bit memory location. The destination
operand is a general-purpose register. When the source operand is an XMM register, the double precision floating-point value is contained in the low quadword of the register.

When a conversion is inexact, the value returned is rounded according to the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register.

If a converted result exceeds the range limits of signed doubleword integer (in non-64-bit modes or 64-bit mode with REX.W/VEX.W/EVEX.W=0), the floating-point invalid exception is raised, and if this exception is masked, the indefinite integer value
(80000000H) is returned.

If a converted result exceeds the range limits of signed quadword integer (in 64-bit mode and REX.W/VEX.W/EVEX.W = 1), the floating-point invalid exception is raised, and if this exception is masked, the indefinite integer value (80000000_00000000H) is
returned.

Legacy SSE instruction: Use of the REX.W prefix promotes the instruction to produce 64-bit data in 64-bit mode. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.

Note: VEX.vvvv and EVEX.vvvv are reserved and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD.

Software should ensure VCVTSD2SI is encoded with VEX.L=0. Encoding VCVTSD2SI with VEX.L=1 may encounter unpredictable behavior across different processor generations.
