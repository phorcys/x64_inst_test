Description ¶

VPMOVDB down converts 32-bit integer elements in the source operand (the second operand) into packed bytes using truncation. VPMOVSDB converts signed 32-bit integers into packed signed bytes using signed saturation. VPMOVUSDB convert unsigned double-word
values into unsigned byte values using unsigned saturation.

The source operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register. The destination operand is a XMM register or a 128/64/32-bit memory location.

Down-converted byte elements are written to the destination operand (the first operand) from the least-significant byte. Byte elements of the destination operand are updated according to the writemask. Bits (MAXVL-1:128/64/32) of the register destination
are zeroed.

EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.
