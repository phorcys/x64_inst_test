ENCLV — Execute an Enclave VMM Function of Specified Leaf Number

Opcode/Instruction Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                                                                Description
NP 0F 01 C0 ENCLV  ZO    V/V                    NA                 This instruction is used to execute privileged SGX leaf functions that are reserved for VMM use. They are used for managing the enclaves.

Description ¶

The ENCLV instruction invokes the virtualization SGX leaf functions for managing enclaves in a virtualized environment. Software specifies the leaf function by setting the appropriate value in the register EAX as input. The registers RBX, RCX, and RDX
have leaf-specific purpose, and may act as input, as output, or may be unused. In non 64-bit mode, the instruction ignores upper 32 bits of the RAX register.

The ENCLV instruction produces an invalid-opcode exception (#UD) if CR0.PE = 0 or RFLAGS.VM = 1, if it is executed in system-management mode (SMM), or not in VMX operation. Additionally, any attempt to execute the instruction when CPL > 0 results in #UD.
The instruction produces a general-protection exception (#GP) if CR0.PG = 0 or if an attempt is made to invoke an undefined leaf function.

Software in VMX root mode of operation can enable execution of the ENCLV instruction in VMX non-root mode by setting enable ENCLV execution control in the VMCS. If enable ENCLV execution control in the VMCS is clear, execution of the ENCLV instruction in
VMX non-root mode results in #UD.

When execution of ENCLV instruction in VMX non-root mode is enabled, software in VMX root operation can intercept the invocation of various ENCLV leaf functions in VMX non-root operation by setting the corresponding bits in the ENCLV-exiting bitmap.

Addresses and operands are 32 bits in 32-bit mode (IA32_EFER.LMA == 0 || CS.L == 0) and are 64 bits in 64-bit mode (IA32_EFER.LMA == 1 && CS.L == 1). CS.D value has no impact on address calculation.

Segment override prefixes and address-size override prefixes are ignored, as is the REX prefix in 64-bit mode.
