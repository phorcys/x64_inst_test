Description ¶

The instruction marks the start of an Intel TSX (RTM) suspend load address tracking region. If the instruction is used inside a transactional region, subsequent loads are not added to the read set of the transaction. If the instruction is used inside a
suspend load address tracking region it will cause transaction abort.

If the instruction is used outside of a transactional region it behaves like a NOP.

Chapter 16, “Programming with Intel® Transactional Synchronization Extensions‚” in the Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1 provides additional information on Intel^® TSX Suspend Load Address Tracking.
