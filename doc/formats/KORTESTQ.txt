KORTESTW/KORTESTB/KORTESTQ/KORTESTD — OR Masks and Set Flags

         Opcode/Instruction           Op/E n 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                              Description
VEX.L0.0F.W0 98 /r KORTESTW k1, k2    RR     V/V                    AVX512F            Bitwise OR 16 bits masks k1 and k2 and update ZF and CF accordingly.
VEX.L0.66.0F.W0 98 /r KORTESTB k1, k2 RR     V/V                    AVX512DQ           Bitwise OR 8 bits masks k1 and k2 and update ZF and CF accordingly.
VEX.L0.0F.W1 98 /r KORTESTQ k1, k2    RR     V/V                    AVX512BW           Bitwise OR 64 bits masks k1 and k2 and update ZF and CF accordingly.
VEX.L0.66.0F.W1 98 /r KORTESTD k1, k2 RR     V/V                    AVX512BW           Bitwise OR 32 bits masks k1 and k2 and update ZF and CF accordingly.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En   Operand 1                   Operand 2
RR    ModRM:reg (w)  ModRM:r/m (r, ModRM:[7:6] must be 11b)

Description ¶

Performs a bitwise OR between the vector mask register k2, and the vector mask register k1, and sets CF and ZF based on the operation result.

ZF flag is set if both sources are 0x0. CF is set if, after the OR operation is done, the operation result is all 1’s.
