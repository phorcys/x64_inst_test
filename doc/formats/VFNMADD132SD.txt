Description ¶

VFNMADD132SD: Multiplies the low packed double precision floating-point value from the first source operand to the low packed double precision floating-point value in the third source operand, adds the negated infinite precision intermediate result to
the low packed double precision floating-point values in the second source operand, performs rounding and stores the resulting packed double precision floating-point value to the destination operand (first source operand).

VFNMADD213SD: Multiplies the low packed double precision floating-point value from the second source operand to the low packed double precision floating-point value in the first source operand, adds the negated infinite precision intermediate result to
the low packed double precision floating-point value in the third source operand, performs rounding and stores the resulting packed double precision floating-point value to the destination operand (first source operand).

VFNMADD231SD: Multiplies the low packed double precision floating-point value from the second source to the low packed double precision floating-point value in the third source operand, adds the negated infinite precision intermediate result to the low
packed double precision floating-point value in the first source operand, performs rounding and stores the resulting packed double precision floating-point value to the destination operand (first source operand).

VEX.128 and EVEX encoded version: The destination operand (also first source operand) is encoded in reg_field. The second source operand is encoded in VEX.vvvv/EVEX.vvvv. The third source operand is encoded in rm_field. Bits 127:64 of the destination are
unchanged. Bits MAXVL-1:128 of the destination register are zeroed.

EVEX encoded version: The low quadword element of the destination is updated according to the writemask.

Compiler tools may optionally support a complementary mnemonic for each instruction mnemonic listed in the opcode/instruction column of the summary table. The behavior of the complementary mnemonic in situations involving NANs are governed by the
definition of the instruction mnemonic defined in the opcode/instruction column.
