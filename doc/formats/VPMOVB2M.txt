Description ¶

Converts a vector register to a mask register. Each element in the destination register is set to 1 or 0 depending on the value of most significant bit of the corresponding element in the source register.

The source operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register. The destination operand is a mask register.

EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.
