Description ¶

Performs a SIMD computation of the approximate reciprocals of the square roots of the four packed single precision floating-point values in the source operand (second operand) and stores the packed single precision floating-point results in the
destination operand. The source operand can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. See Figure 10-5 in the Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for an illustration
of a SIMD single precision floating-point operation.

The relative error for this approximation is:

|Relative Error| ≤ 1.5 ∗ 2^−12

The RSQRTPS instruction is not affected by the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register. When a source value is a 0.0, an ∞ of the sign of the source value is returned. A denormal source value is treated as a 0.0 (of the same sign). When a source
value is a negative value (other than −0.0), a floating-point indefinite is returned. When a source value is an SNaN or QNaN, the SNaN is converted to a QNaN or the source QNaN is returned.

In 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).

128-bit Legacy SSE version: The second source can be an XMM register or an 128-bit memory location. The destination is not distinct from the first source XMM register and the upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM register destination are
unmodified.

VEX.128 encoded version: the first source operand is an XMM register or 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM register destination are zeroed.

VEX.256 encoded version: The first source operand is a YMM register. The second source operand can be a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. The destination operand is a YMM register.

Note: In VEX-encoded versions, VEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD.
