Description ¶

Performs a floating-point scale of the scalar single-precision floating-point value in the first source operand by multiplying it by 2 to the power of the float32 value in second source operand.

The equation of this operation is given by:

xmm1 := xmm2*2^floor(xmm3).

Floor(xmm3) means maximum integer value ≤ xmm3.

If the result cannot be represented in single-precision, then the proper overflow response (for positive scaling operand), or the proper underflow response (for negative scaling operand) is issued. The overflow and underflow responses are dependent on
the rounding mode (for IEEE-compliant rounding), as well as on other settings in MXCSR (exception mask bits, FTZ bit), and on the SAE bit.

EVEX encoded version: The first source operand is an XMM register. The second source operand is an XMM register or a memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register conditionally updated with writemask k1.

Handling of special-case input values are listed in Table 5-39 and Table 5-43.
