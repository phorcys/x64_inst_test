PTWRITE — Write Data to a Processor Trace Packet

       Opcode/Instruction         Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                                              Description
F3 REX.W 0F AE /4 PTWRITE r64/m64 RM    V/N.E                  PTWRITE            Reads the data from r64/m64 to encode into a PTW packet if dependencies are met (see details below).
F3 0F AE /4 PTWRITE r32/m32       RM    V/V                    PTWRITE            Reads the data from r32/m32 to encode into a PTW packet if dependencies are met (see details below).

Description ¶

This instruction reads data in the source operand and sends it to the Intel Processor Trace hardware to be encoded in a PTW packet if TriggerEn, ContextEn, FilterEn, and PTWEn are all set to 1. For more details on these values, see Intel^® 64 and IA-32
Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3C, Section 33.2.2, “Software Trace Instrumentation with PTWRITE.” The size of data is 64-bit if using REX.W in 64-bit mode, otherwise 32-bits of data are copied from the source operand.

Note: The instruction will #UD if prefix 66H is used.
