Description ¶

VPMOVWB down converts 16-bit integers into packed bytes using truncation. VPMOVSWB converts signed 16-bit integers into packed signed bytes using signed saturation. VPMOVUSWB convert unsigned word values into unsigned byte values using unsigned
saturation.

The source operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register. The destination operand is a YMM/XMM/XMM register or a 256/128/64-bit memory location.

Down-converted byte elements are written to the destination operand (the first operand) from the least-significant byte. Byte elements of the destination operand are updated according to the writemask. Bits (MAXVL-1:256/128/64) of the register
destination are zeroed.

Note: EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.
