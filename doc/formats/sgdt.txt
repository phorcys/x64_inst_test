Description ¶

Stores the content of the global descriptor table register (GDTR) in the destination operand. The destination operand specifies a memory location.

In legacy or compatibility mode, the destination operand is a 6-byte memory location. If the operand-size attribute is 16 or 32 bits, the 16-bit limit field of the register is stored in the low 2 bytes of the memory location and the 32-bit base address
is stored in the high 4 bytes.

In 64-bit mode, the operand size is fixed at 8+2 bytes. The instruction stores an 8-byte base and a 2-byte limit.

SGDT is useful only by operating-system software. However, it can be used in application programs without causing an exception to be generated if CR4.UMIP = 0. See “LGDT/LIDT—Load Global/Interrupt Descriptor Table Register” in Chapter 3, Intel^® 64 and
IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2A, for information on loading the GDTR and IDTR.

IA-32 Architecture Compatibility ¶

The 16-bit form of the SGDT is compatible with the Intel 286 processor if the upper 8 bits are not referenced. The Intel 286 processor fills these bits with 1s; processor generations later than the Intel 286 processor fill these bits with 0s.
