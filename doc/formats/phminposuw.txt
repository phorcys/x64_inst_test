Description ¶

Determine the minimum unsigned word value in the source operand (second operand) and place the unsigned word in the low word (bits 0-15) of the destination operand (first operand). The word index of the minimum value is stored in bits 16-18 of the
destination operand. The remaining upper bits of the destination are set to zero.

128-bit Legacy SSE version: Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding XMM destination register remain unchanged.

VEX.128 encoded version: Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the destination XMM register are zeroed. VEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b, VEX.L must be 0, otherwise the instruction will #UD.
