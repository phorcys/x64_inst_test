Description ¶

Converts two packed signed doubleword integers in the source operand (second operand) to two packed double precision floating-point values in the destination operand (first operand).

The source operand can be an MMX technology register or a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. In addition, depending on the operand configuration:

  • For operands xmm, mm: the instruction causes a transition from x87 FPU to MMX technology operation (that is, the x87 FPU top-of-stack pointer is set to 0 and the x87 FPU tag word is set to all 0s [valid]). If this instruction is executed while an x87
    FPU floating-point exception is pending, the exception is handled before the CVTPI2PD instruction is executed.
  • For operands xmm, m64: the instruction does not cause a transition to MMX technology and does not take x87 FPU exceptions.

In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).
