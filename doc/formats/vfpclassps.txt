Description ¶

The FPCLASSPS instruction checks the packed single-precision floating-point values for special categories, specified by the set bits in the imm8 byte. Each set bit in imm8 specifies a category of floating-point values that the input data element is
classified against. The classified results of all specified categories of an input value are ORed together to form the final boolean result for the input element. The result of each element is written to the corresponding bit in a mask register k2
according to the writemask k1. Bits [MAX_KL-1:16/8/4] of the destination are cleared.

The classification categories specified by imm8 are shown in Figure 5-13. The classification test for each category is listed in Table 5-14.

The source operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register, a 512/256/128-bit memory location, or a 512/256/128-bit vector broadcasted from a 32-bit memory location.

EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.
