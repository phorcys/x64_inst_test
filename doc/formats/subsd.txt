Description ¶

Subtract the low double precision floating-point value in the second source operand from the first source operand and stores the double precision floating-point result in the low quadword of the destination operand.

The second source operand can be an XMM register or a 64-bit memory location. The first source and destination operands are XMM registers.

128-bit Legacy SSE version: The destination and first source operand are the same. Bits (MAXVL-1:64) of the corresponding destination register remain unchanged.

VEX.128 and EVEX encoded versions: Bits (127:64) of the XMM register destination are copied from corresponding bits in the first source operand. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the destination register are zeroed.

EVEX encoded version: The low quadword element of the destination operand is updated according to the write-mask.

Software should ensure VSUBSD is encoded with VEX.L=0. Encoding VSUBSD with VEX.L=1 may encounter unpredictable behavior across different processor generations.
