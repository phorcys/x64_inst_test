EMODPE — Extend an EPC Page Permissions

  Opcode/Instruction    Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                              Description
EAX = 06H ENCLU[EMODPE] IR    V/V                    SGX2               This leaf function extends the access rights of an existing EPC page.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En EAX         RBX                        RCX
IR    EMODPE (In) Address of a SECINFO (In)  Address of the destination EPC page (In)

Description ¶

This leaf function extends the access rights associated with an existing EPC page in the running enclave. THE RWX bits of the SECINFO parameter are treated as a permissions mask; supplying a value that does not extend the page permissions will have no
effect. This instruction leaf can only be executed when inside the enclave.

RBX contains the effective address of a SECINFO structure while RCX contains the effective address of an EPC page. The table below provides additional information on the memory parameter of the EMODPE leaf function.

EMODPE Memory Parameter Semantics ¶

SECINFO                               EPCPAGE
Read access permitted by Non Enclave  Read access permitted by Enclave

The instruction faults if any of the following:

EMODPE Faulting Conditions ¶

The operands are not properly aligned.    If security attributes of the SECINFO page make the page inaccessible.
The EPC page is locked by another thread. RBX does not contain an effective address in an EPC page in the running enclave.
The EPC page is not valid.                RCX does not contain an effective address of an EPC page in the running enclave.
SECINFO contains an invalid request.
