Description ¶

VEXTRACTF128/VEXTRACTF32x4 and VEXTRACTF64x2 extract 128-bits of single precision floating-point values from the source operand (the second operand) and store to the low 128-bit of the destination operand (the first operand). The 128-bit data extraction
occurs at an 128-bit granular offset specified by imm8[0] (256-bit) or imm8[1:0] as the multiply factor. The destination may be either a vector register or an 128-bit memory location.

VEXTRACTF32x4: The low 128-bit of the destination operand is updated at 32-bit granularity according to the writemask.

VEXTRACTF32x8 and VEXTRACTF64x4 extract 256-bits of double precision floating-point values from the source operand (second operand) and store to the low 256-bit of the destination operand (the first operand). The 256-bit data extraction occurs at an
256-bit granular offset specified by imm8[0] (256-bit) or imm8[0] as the multiply factor The destination may be either a vector register or a 256-bit memory location.

VEXTRACTF64x4: The low 256-bit of the destination operand is updated at 64-bit granularity according to the writemask.

VEX.vvvv and EVEX.vvvv are reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.

The high 6 bits of the immediate are ignored.

If VEXTRACTF128 is encoded with VEX.L= 0, an attempt to execute the instruction encoded with VEX.L= 0 will cause an #UD exception.
