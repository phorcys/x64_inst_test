Description ¶

(V)PHSUBSW performs horizontal subtraction on each adjacent pair of 16-bit signed integers by subtracting the most significant word from the least significant word of each pair in the source and destination operands. The signed, saturated 16-bit results
are packed to the destination operand (first operand). When the source operand is a 128-bit memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary or a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated.

Legacy SSE version: Both operands can be MMX registers. The second source operand can be an MMX register or a 64-bit memory location.

128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source and destination operands are XMM registers. The second source operand is an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged.

In 64-bit mode, use the REX prefix to access additional registers.

VEX.128 encoded version: The first source and destination operands are XMM registers. The second source operand is an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the destination YMM register are zeroed.

VEX.256 encoded version: The first source and destination operands are YMM registers. The second source operand can be an YMM register or a 256-bit memory location.
