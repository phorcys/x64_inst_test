Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En  Tuple Type       Operand 1       Operand 2     Operand 3   Operand 4
A     N/A           ModRM:reg (r, w)  ModRM:r/m (r) N/A           N/A
B     N/A           ModRM:reg (w)     VEX.vvvv (r)  ModRM:r/m (r) N/A
C     Tuple1 Scalar ModRM:reg (w)     EVEX.vvvv (r) ModRM:r/m (r) N/A

Description ¶

Multiplies the low single precision floating-point value from the second source operand by the low single precision floating-point value in the first source operand, and stores the single precision floating-point result in the destination operand. The
second source operand can be an XMM register or a 32-bit memory location. The first source operand and the destination operands are XMM registers.

128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source operand and the destination operand are the same. Bits (MAXVL-1:32) of the corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged.

VEX.128 and EVEX encoded version: The first source operand is an xmm register encoded by VEX.vvvv. The three high-order doublewords of the destination operand are copied from the first source operand. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the destination register are
zeroed.

EVEX encoded version: The low doubleword element of the destination operand is updated according to the write-mask.

Software should ensure VMULSS is encoded with VEX.L=0. Encoding VMULSS with VEX.L=1 may encounter unpredictable behavior across different processor generations.
