Description ¶

This instruction allows guest software can make a call for service into an underlying VM monitor. The details of the programming interface for such calls are VMM-specific; this instruction does nothing more than cause a VM exit, registering the
appropriate exit reason.

Use of this instruction in VMX root operation invokes an SMM monitor (see Section 32.15.2). This invocation will activate the dual-monitor treatment of system-management interrupts (SMIs) and system-management mode (SMM) if it is not already active (see
Section 32.15.6).
