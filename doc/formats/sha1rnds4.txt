Description ¶

The SHA1RNDS4 instruction performs four rounds of SHA1 operation using an initial SHA1 state (A,B,C,D) from the first operand (which is a source operand and the destination operand) and some pre-computed sum of the next 4 round message dwords, and state
variable E from the second operand (a source operand). The updated SHA1 state (A,B,C,D) after four rounds of processing is stored in the destination operand.
