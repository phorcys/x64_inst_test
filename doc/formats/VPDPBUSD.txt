Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En Tuple     Operand 1       Operand 2     Operand 3   Operand 4
A     N/A   ModRM:reg (r, w)  VEX.vvvv (r)  ModRM:r/m (r) N/A
B     Full  ModRM:reg (r, w)  EVEX.vvvv (r) ModRM:r/m (r) N/A

Description ¶

Multiplies the individual unsigned bytes of the first source operand by the corresponding signed bytes of the second source operand, producing intermediate signed word results. The word results are then summed and accumulated in the destination dword
element size operand.

This instruction supports memory fault suppression.
