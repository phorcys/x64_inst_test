Description ¶

This instruction computes 4 sequential register source-block dot-products of two signed word operands with doubleword accumulation and signed saturation. The memory operand is sequentially selected in each of the four steps.

In the above box, the notation of “+3” is used to denote that the instruction accesses 4 source registers based on that operand; sources are consecutive, start in a multiple of 4 boundary, and contain the encoded register operand.

This instruction supports memory fault suppression. The entire memory operand is loaded if any bit of the lowest 16-bits of the mask is set to 1 or if a “no masking” encoding is used.

The tuple type Tuple1_4X implies that four 32-bit elements (16 bytes) are referenced by the memory operation portion of this instruction.
