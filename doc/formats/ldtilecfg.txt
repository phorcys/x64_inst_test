Description ¶

The LDTILECFG instruction takes an operand containing a pointer to a 64-byte memory location containing the description of the tiles to be supported. In order to configure the tiles, the AMX-TILE bit in CPUID must be set and the operating system has to
have enabled the tiles architecture.

The memory area contains the palette and describes how many tiles are being used and defines each tile in terms of rows and column bytes. Requests must be compatible with the restrictions provided by CPUID; see Table 3-10 below.

Byte(s)       Field Name                                        Description
0       palette                Palette selects the supported configuration of the tiles that will be used.
1       start_row              start_row is used for storing the restart values for interrupted operations.
2-15    reserved, must be zero
16-17   tile0.colsb            Tile 0 bytes per row.
18-19   tile1.colsb            Tile 1 bytes per row.
20-21   tile2.colsb            Tile 2 bytes per row.
...     (sequence continues)
30-31   tile7.colsb            Tile 7 bytes per row.
32-47   reserved, must be zero
48      tile0.rows             Tile 0 rows.
49      tile1.rows             Tile 1 rows.
50      tile2.rows             Tile 2 rows.
...     (sequence continues)
55      tile7.rows             Tile 7 rows.
56-63   reserved, must be zero


Table 3-10. Memory Area Layout

If a tile row and column pair is not used to specify tile parameters, they must have the value zero. All enabled tiles (based on the palette) must be configured. Specifying tile parameters for more tiles than the implementation limit or the palette limit
results in a #GP fault.

If the palette_id is zero, that signifies the INIT state for both TILECFG and TILEDATA. Tiles are zeroed in the INIT state. The only legal non-INIT value for palette_id is 1.

Any attempt to execute the LDTILECFG instruction inside an Intel TSX transaction will result in a transaction abort.
