EAUG — Add a Page to an Initialized Enclave

 Opcode/Instruction   Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                        Description
EAX = 0DH ENCLS[EAUG] IR    V/V                    SGX2               This leaf function adds a page to an initialized enclave.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En EAX       RBX                         RCX
IR    EAUG (In) Address of a PAGEINFO (In)  Address of the destination EPC page (In)

Description ¶

This leaf function zeroes a page of EPC memory, associates the EPC page with an SECS page residing in the EPC, and stores the linear address and security attributes in the EPCM. As part of the association, the security attributes are configured to
prevent access to the EPC page until a corresponding invocation of the EACCEPT leaf or EACCEPTCOPY leaf confirms the addition of the new page into the enclave. This instruction can only be executed when current privilege level is 0.

RBX contains the effective address of a PAGEINFO structure while RCX contains the effective address of an EPC page. The table below provides additional information on the memory parameter of the EAUG leaf function.

EAUG Memory Parameter Semantics ¶

PAGEINFO                             PAGEINFO.SECS                           PAGEINFO.SRCPGE PAGEINFO.SECINFO                     EPCPAGE
Read access permitted by Non Enclave Read/Write access permitted by Enclave  Must be zero    Read access permitted by Non Enclave Write access permitted by Enclave

The instruction faults if any of the following:

EAUG Faulting Conditions ¶

The operands are not properly aligned.    Unsupported security attributes are set.
Refers to an invalid SECS.                Reference is made to an SECS that is locked by another thread.
The EPC page is locked by another thread. RCX does not contain an effective address of an EPC page.
The EPC page is already valid.            The specified enclave offset is outside of the enclave address space.
The SECS has been initialized.
