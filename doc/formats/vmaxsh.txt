Description ¶

This instruction performs a compare of the low packed FP16 values in the first source operand and the second source operand and returns the maximum value for the pair of values to the destination operand.

If the values being compared are both 0.0s (of either sign), the value in the second operand (source operand) is returned. If a value in the second operand is an SNaN, then SNaN is forwarded unchanged to the destination (that is, a QNaN version of the
SNaN is not returned).

If only one value is a NaN (SNaN or QNaN) for this instruction, the second operand (source operand), either a NaN or a valid floating-point value, is written to the result. If instead of this behavior, it is required that the NaN source operand (from
either the first or second operand) be returned, the action of VMAXSH can be emulated using a sequence of instructions, such as, a comparison followed by AND, ANDN, and OR.

Bits 127:16 of the destination operand are copied from the corresponding bits of the first source operand. Bits MAXVL-1:128 of the destination operand are zeroed. The low FP16 element of the destination is updated according to the writemask.
