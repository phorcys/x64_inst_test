EDBGWR — Write to a Debug Enclave

  Opcode/Instruction    Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                           Description
EAX = 05H ENCLS[EDBGWR] IR    V/V                    SGX1               This leaf function writes a dword/quadword to a debug enclave.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En EAX                                 RBX                                         RCX
IR    EDBGWR (In) Return error code (Out) Data to be written to a debug enclave (In)  Address of Target memory in the EPC (In)

Description ¶

This leaf function copies the content in EBX/RBX to an EPC page belonging to a debug enclave. Eight bytes are written in 64-bit mode, four bytes are written in non-64-bit modes. The size of data cannot be overridden.

The effective address of the target location inside the EPC is provided in the register RCX.

EDBGWR Memory Parameter Semantics ¶

EPCQW
Write access permitted by Enclave

The instruction faults if any of the following:

EDBGWR Faulting Conditions ¶

RCX points into a page that is an SECS.                                         RCX does not resolve to a naturally aligned linear address.
RCX points to a page that does not belong to an enclave that is in debug mode.  RCX points to a location inside a TCS that is not the FLAGS word.
An operand causing any segment violation.                                       May page fault.
CPL > 0.

The error codes are:

Error Code (see Table 38-4)                                   Description
No Error                    EDBGWR successful.
SGX_PAGE_NOT_DEBUGGABLE     The EPC page cannot be accessed because it is in the PENDING or MODIFIED state.


Table 38-20. EDBGWR Return Value in RAX

This instruction ignores the EPCM RWX attributes on the enclave page. Consequently, violation of EPCM RWX attributes via EDBGRD does not result in a #GP.
