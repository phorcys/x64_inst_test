EDBGRD — Read From a Debug Enclave

  Opcode/Instruction    Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                           Description
EAX = 04H ENCLS[EDBGRD] IR    V/V                    SGX1               This leaf function reads a dword/quadword from a debug enclave.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En EAX                                 RBX                                  RCX
IR    EDBGRD (In) Return error code (Out) Data read from a debug enclave (Out) Address of source memory in the EPC (In)

Description ¶

This leaf function copies a quadword/doubleword from an EPC page belonging to a debug enclave into the RBX register. Eight bytes are read in 64-bit mode, four bytes are read in non-64-bit modes. The size of data read cannot be overridden.

The effective address of the source location inside the EPC is provided in the register RCX.

EDBGRD Memory Parameter Semantics ¶

EPCQW
Read access permitted by Enclave

The error codes are:

Error Code (see Table 38-4)                                   Description
No Error                    EDBGRD successful.
SGX_PAGE_NOT_DEBUGGABLE     The EPC page cannot be accessed because it is in the PENDING or MODIFIED state.

The instruction faults if any of the following:

EDBGRD Faulting Conditions ¶

RCX points into a page that is an SECS.                                        RCX does not resolve to a naturally aligned linear address.
RCX points to a page that does not belong to an enclave that is in debug mode. RCX points to a location inside a TCS that is beyond the architectural size of the TCS (SGX_TCS_LIMIT).
An operand causing any segment violation.                                      May page fault.
CPL > 0.

This instruction ignores the EPCM RWX attributes on the enclave page. Consequently, violation of EPCM RWX attributes via EDBGRD does not result in a #GP.
