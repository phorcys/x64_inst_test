EACCEPT — Accept Changes to an EPC Page

   Opcode/Instruction    Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                                            Description

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En EAX                                  RBX                       RCX

Description ¶

This leaf function accepts changes to a page in the running enclave by verifying that the security attributes specified in the SECINFO match the security attributes of the page in the EPCM. This instruction leaf can only be executed when inside the
enclave.

RBX contains the effective address of a SECINFO structure while RCX contains the effective address of an EPC page. The table below provides additional information on the memory parameter of the EACCEPT leaf function.

EACCEPT Memory Parameter Semantics ¶

SECINFO                               EPCPAGE (Destination)

The instruction faults if any of the following:

EACCEPT Faulting Conditions ¶

The operands are not properly aligned.                                 RBX does not contain an effective address in an EPC page in the running enclave.
The EPC page is locked by another thread.                              RCX does not contain an effective address of an EPC page in the running enclave.
The EPC page is not valid.                                             Page type is PT_REG and MODIFIED bit is 0.
SECINFO contains an invalid request.                                   Page type is PT_TCS or PT_TRIM and PENDING bit is 0 and MODIFIED bit is 1.
If security attributes of the SECINFO page make the page inaccessible.

The error codes are:

 Error Code (see Table 38-4)                                Description
No Error                      EACCEPT successful.
SGX_PAGE_ATTRIBUTES_MISMATCH  The attributes of the target EPC page do not match the expected values.
SGX_NOT_TRACKED               The OS did not complete an ETRACK on the target page.
