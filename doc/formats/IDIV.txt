Description ¶

Divides the (signed) value in the AX, DX:AX, or EDX:EAX (dividend) by the source operand (divisor) and stores the result in the AX (AH:AL), DX:AX, or EDX:EAX registers. The source operand can be a general-purpose register or a memory location. The action
of this instruction depends on the operand size (dividend/divisor).

Non-integral results are truncated (chopped) towards 0. The remainder is always less than the divisor in magnitude. Overflow is indicated with the #DE (divide error) exception rather than with the CF flag.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Use of the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits. In 64-bit mode when REX.W is applied, the instruction
divides the signed value in RDX:RAX by the source operand. RAX contains a 64-bit quotient; RDX contains a 64-bit remainder.

See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits. See Table 3-51.
