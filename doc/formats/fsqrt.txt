Opcode  Mode Leg Mode                           Description
D9 FA                 Computes square root of ST(0) and stores the result in ST(0).

Description ¶

Computes the square root of the source value in the ST(0) register and stores the result in ST(0).

The following table shows the results obtained when taking the square root of various classes of numbers, assuming that neither overflow nor underflow occurs.

SRC (ST(0))  DEST (ST(0))
−∞           *
−F           *
−0           −0
+0           +0
+F           +F
+∞           +∞
NaN          NaN
