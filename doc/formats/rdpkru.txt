RDPKRU — Read Protection Key Rights for User Pages

NP 0F 01 EE RDPKRU      ZO    V/V                    OSPKE              Reads PKRU into EAX.

Description ¶

Reads the value of PKRU into EAX and clears EDX. ECX must be 0 when RDPKRU is executed; otherwise, a general-protection exception (#GP) occurs.

RDPKRU can be executed only if CR4.PKE = 1; otherwise, an invalid-opcode exception (#UD) occurs. Software can discover the value of CR4.PKE by examining CPUID.(EAX=07H,ECX=0H):ECX.OSPKE [bit 4].

On processors that support the Intel 64 Architecture, the high-order 32-bits of RCX are ignored and the high-order 32-bits of RDX and RAX are cleared.
