Description ¶

This leaf function copies a page from regular main memory to the EPC. As part of the copying process, the page is cryptographically authenticated and decrypted. This instruction can only be executed when current privilege level is 0.

The ELDB leaf function sets the BLOCK bit in the EPCM entry for the destination page in the EPC after copying. The ELDU leaf function clears the BLOCK bit in the EPCM entry for the destination page in the EPC after copying.

RBX contains the effective address of a PAGEINFO structure; RCX contains the effective address of the destination EPC page; RDX holds the effective address of the version array slot that holds the version of the page.

The ELDBC/ELDUC leafs are very similar to ELDB and ELDU. They provide an error code on the concurrency conflict for any of the pages which need to acquire a lock. These include the destination, SECS, and VA slot.

The table below provides additional information on the memory parameter of ELDB/ELDU leaf functions.

ELDB/ELDU/ELDBC/ELBUC Memory Parameter Semantics ¶

Non-enclave read access Non-enclave read access Non-enclave read access Enclave read/write access Read/Write access permitted by Enclave Read/Write access permitted by Enclave

The error codes are:

Error Code (see Table 38-4)        Description
No Error                     ELDB/ELDU successful.
SGX_MAC_COMPARE_FAIL         If the MAC check fails.
