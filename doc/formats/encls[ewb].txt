 Opcode/Instruction  Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                                  Description
EAX = 0BH ENCLS[EWB] IR    V/V                    SGX1               This leaf function invalidates an EPC page and writes it out to main memory.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Description ¶

This leaf function copies a page from the EPC to regular main memory. As part of the copying process, the page is cryptographically protected. This instruction can only be executed when current privilege level is 0.

The table below provides additional information on the memory parameter of EPA leaf function.
