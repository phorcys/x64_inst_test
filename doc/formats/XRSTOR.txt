Description ¶

Performs a full or partial restore of processor state components from the XSAVE area located at the memory address specified by the source operand. The implicit EDX:EAX register pair specifies a 64-bit instruction mask. The specific state components
restored correspond to the bits set in the requested-feature bitmap (RFBM), which is the logical-AND of EDX:EAX and XCR0.

The format of the XSAVE area is detailed in Section 13.4, “XSAVE Area,” of Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1. Like FXRSTOR and FXSAVE, the memory format used for x87 state depends on a REX.W prefix; see Section
13.5.1, “x87 State” of Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1.

Section 13.8, “Operation of XRSTOR,” of Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1 provides a detailed description of the operation of the XRSTOR instruction. The following items provide a highlevel outline:

  • Execution of XRSTOR may take one of two forms: standard and compacted. Bit 63 of the XCOMP_BV field in the XSAVE header determines which form is used: value 0 specifies the standard form, while value 1 specifies the compacted form.
  • If RFBM[i] = 0, XRSTOR does not update state component i.^1
  • If RFBM[i] = 1 and bit i is clear in the XSTATE_BV field in the XSAVE header, XRSTOR initializes state component i.
  • If RFBM[i] = 1 and XSTATE_BV[i] = 1, XRSTOR loads state component i from the XSAVE area.
  • The standard form of XRSTOR treats MXCSR (which is part of state component 1 — SSE) differently from the XMM registers. If either form attempts to load MXCSR with an illegal value, a general-protection exception (#GP) occurs.
  • XRSTOR loads the internal value XRSTOR_INFO, which may be used to optimize a subsequent execution of XSAVEOPT or XSAVES.
  • Immediately following an execution of XRSTOR, the processor tracks as in-use (not in initial configuration) any state component i for which RFBM[i] = 1 and XSTATE_BV[i] = 1; it tracks as modified any state component i for which RFBM[i] = 0.

Use of a source operand not aligned to 64-byte boundary (for 64-bit and 32-bit modes) results in a general-protection (#GP) exception. In 64-bit mode, the upper 32 bits of RDX and RAX are ignored.

See Section 13.6, “Processor Tracking of XSAVE-Managed State,” of Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1 for discussion of the bitmaps XINUSE and XMODIFIED and of the quantity XRSTOR_INFO.

    1. There is an exception if RFBM[1] = 0 and RFBM[2] = 1. In this case, the standard form of XRSTOR will load MXCSR from memory, even though MXCSR is part of state component 1 — SSE. The compacted form of XRSTOR does not make this exception.
