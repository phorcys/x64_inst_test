Description ¶

Round the single precision floating-point value in the lowest dword of the source operand (second operand) using the rounding mode specified in the immediate operand (third operand) and place the result in the destination operand (first operand). The
rounding process rounds a single precision floating-point input to an integer value and returns the result as a single precision floating-point value in the lowest position. The upper three single precision floating-point values in the destination are
retained.

The immediate operand specifies control fields for the rounding operation, three bit fields are defined and shown in Figure 4-24. Bit 3 of the immediate byte controls processor behavior for a precision exception, bit 2 selects the source of rounding mode
control. Bits 1:0 specify a non-sticky rounding-mode value (Table 4-18 lists the encoded values for rounding-mode field).

The Precision Floating-Point Exception is signaled according to the immediate operand. If any source operand is an SNaN then it will be converted to a QNaN. If DAZ is set to ‘1 then denormals will be converted to zero before rounding.

128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source operand and the destination operand are the same. Bits (MAXVL-1:32) of the corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged.

VEX.128 encoded version: Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the destination YMM register are zeroed.
