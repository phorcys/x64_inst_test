Description ¶

The SHLD instruction is used for multi-precision shifts of 64 bits or more.

The instruction shifts the first operand (destination operand) to the left the number of bits specified by the third operand (count operand). The second operand (source operand) provides bits to shift in from the right (starting with bit 0 of the
destination operand).

The destination operand can be a register or a memory location; the source operand is a register. The count operand is an unsigned integer that can be stored in an immediate byte or in the CL register. If the count operand is CL, the shift count is the
logical AND of CL and a count mask. In non-64-bit modes and default 64-bit mode; only bits 0 through 4 of the count are used. This masks the count to a value between 0 and 31. If a count is greater than the operand size, the result is undefined.

If the count is 1 or greater, the CF flag is filled with the last bit shifted out of the destination operand. For a 1-bit shift, the OF flag is set if a sign change occurred; otherwise, it is cleared. If the count operand is 0, flags are not affected.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits (upgrading the count mask
to 6 bits). See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.
