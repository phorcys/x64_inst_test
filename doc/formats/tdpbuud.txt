Description ¶

For each possible combination of (row of tmm2, column of tmm3), the instruction performs a set of SIMD dot-products on all corresponding four byte elements, one from tmm2 and one from tmm3, adds the results of those dot-products, and then accumulates the
result into the corresponding row and column of tmm1. Each dword in input tiles tmm2 and tmm3 is interpreted as four byte elements. These may be signed or unsigned. Each letter in the two-letter pattern SU, US, SS, UU indicates the signed/unsigned nature
of the values in tmm2 and tmm3, respectively.

Any attempt to execute the TDPBSSD/TDPBSUD/TDPBUSD/TDPBUUD instructions inside an Intel TSX transaction will result in a transaction abort.
