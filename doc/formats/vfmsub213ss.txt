Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En  Tuple Type       Operand 1       Operand 2     Operand 3   Operand 4
A     N/A           ModRM:reg (r, w)  VEX.vvvv (r)  ModRM:r/m (r) N/A
B     Tuple1 Scalar ModRM:reg (r, w)  EVEX.vvvv (r) ModRM:r/m (r) N/A

Description ¶

Performs a SIMD multiply-subtract computation on the low packed single precision floating-point values using three source operands and writes the multiply-subtract result in the destination operand. The destination operand is also the first source
operand. The second operand must be a XMM register. The third source operand can be a XMM register or a 32-bit memory location.

VFMSUB132SS: Multiplies the low packed single precision floating-point value from the first source operand to the low packed single precision floating-point value in the third source operand. From the infinite precision intermediate result, subtracts the
low packed single precision floating-point values in the second source operand, performs rounding and stores the resulting packed single precision floating-point value to the destination operand (first source operand).

VFMSUB213SS: Multiplies the low packed single precision floating-point value from the second source operand to the low packed single precision floating-point value in the first source operand. From the infinite precision intermediate result, subtracts
the low packed single precision floating-point value in the third source operand, performs rounding and stores the resulting packed single precision floating-point value to the destination operand (first source operand).

VFMSUB231SS: Multiplies the low packed single precision floating-point value from the second source to the low packed single precision floating-point value in the third source operand. From the infinite precision intermediate result, subtracts the low
packed single precision floating-point value in the first source operand, performs rounding and stores the resulting packed single precision floating-point value to the destination operand (first source operand).

VEX.128 and EVEX encoded version: The destination operand (also first source operand) is encoded in reg_field. The second source operand is encoded in VEX.vvvv/EVEX.vvvv. The third source operand is encoded in rm_field. Bits 127:32 of the destination are
unchanged. Bits MAXVL-1:128 of the destination register are zeroed.

EVEX encoded version: The low doubleword element of the destination is updated according to the writemask.

Compiler tools may optionally support a complementary mnemonic for each instruction mnemonic listed in the opcode/instruction column of the summary table. The behavior of the complementary mnemonic in situations involving NANs are governed by the
definition of the instruction mnemonic defined in the opcode/instruction column.
