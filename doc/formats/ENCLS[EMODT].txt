EMODT — Change the Type of an EPC Page

  Opcode/Instruction   Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                          Description
EAX = 0FH ENCLS[EMODT] IR    V/V                    SGX2               This leaf function changes the type of an existing EPC page.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En EAX                                RBX                        RCX
IR    EMODT (In) Return Error Code (Out) Address of a SECINFO (In)  Address of the destination EPC page (In)

Description ¶

This leaf function modifies the type of an EPC page. The security attributes are configured to prevent access to the EPC page at its new type until a corresponding invocation of the EACCEPT leaf confirms the modification. This instruction can only be
executed when current privilege level is 0.

RBX contains the effective address of a SECINFO structure while RCX contains the effective address of an EPC page. The table below provides additional information on the memory parameter of the EMODT leaf function.

EMODT Memory Parameter Semantics ¶

SECINFO                               EPCPAGE
Read access permitted by Non Enclave  Read/Write access permitted by Enclave

The instruction faults if any of the following:

EMODT Faulting Conditions ¶

The operands are not properly aligned.    If unsupported security attributes are set.
The Enclave is not initialized.           SECS is locked by another thread.
The EPC page is locked by another thread. RCX does not contain an effective address of an EPC page in the running enclave.
The EPC page is not valid.

The error codes are:

Error Code (see Table 38-4)                                   Description
No Error                    EMODT successful.
SGX_PAGE_NOT_MODIFIABLE     The EPC page cannot be modified because it is in the PENDING or MODIFIED state.
SGX_EPC_PAGE_CONFLICT       Page is being written by EADD, EAUG, ECREATE, ELDU/B, EMODPR, or EWB.
