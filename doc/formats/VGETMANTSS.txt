Description ¶

Convert the single-precision floating values in the low doubleword element of the second source operand (the third operand) to single-precision floating-point value with the mantissa normalization and sign control specified by the imm8 byte, see Figure
5-15. The converted result is written to the low doubleword element of the destination operand (the first operand) using writemask k1. Bits (127:32) of the XMM register destination are copied from corresponding bits in the first source operand. The
normalized mantissa is specified by interv (imm8[1:0]) and the sign control (sc) is specified by bits 3:2 of the immediate byte.

The conversion operation is:

GetMant(x) = ±2^k|x.significand|

where:

1 <= |x.significand| < 2

Unbiased exponent k can be either 0 or -1, depending on the interval range defined by interv, the range of the significand and whether the exponent of the source is even or odd. The sign of the final result is determined by sc and the source sign. The
encoded value of imm8[1:0] and sign control are shown in Figure 5-15.

The converted single-precision floating-point result is encoded according to the sign control, the unbiased exponent k (adding bias) and a mantissa normalized to the range specified by interv.

The GetMant() function follows Table 5-18 when dealing with floating-point special numbers.

If writemasking is used, the low doubleword element of the destination operand is conditionally updated depending on the value of writemask register k1. If writemasking is not used, the low doubleword element of the destination operand is unconditionally
updated.
