Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En     Operand 1       Operand 2     Operand 3   Operand 4
RMI   ModRM:reg (r, w)  ModRM:r/m (r) imm8          N/A
RVMI  ModRM:reg (w)     VEX.vvvv (r)  ModRM:r/m (r) imm8[3:0]

Description ¶

Double-precision floating-point values from the second source operand (third operand) are conditionally merged with values from the first source operand (second operand) and written to the destination operand (first operand). The immediate bits [3:0]
determine whether the corresponding double precision floating-point value in the destination is copied from the second source or first source. If a bit in the mask, corresponding to a word, is ”1”, then the double precision floating-point value in the
second source operand is copied, else the value in the first source operand is copied.

128-bit Legacy SSE version: The second source can be an XMM register or an 128-bit memory location. The destination is not distinct from the first source XMM register and the upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM register destination are
unmodified.

VEX.128 encoded version: the first source operand is an XMM register. The second source operand is an XMM register or 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM register
destination are zeroed.

VEX.256 encoded version: The first source operand is a YMM register. The second source operand can be a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. The destination operand is a YMM register.
