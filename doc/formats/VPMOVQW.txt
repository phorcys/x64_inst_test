Description ¶

VPMOVQW down converts 64-bit integer elements in the source operand (the second operand) into packed words using truncation. VPMOVSQW converts signed 64-bit integers into packed signed words using signed saturation. VPMOVUSQW convert unsigned quad-word
values into unsigned word values using unsigned saturation.

The source operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register. The destination operand is a XMM register or a 128/64/32-bit memory location.

Down-converted word elements are written to the destination operand (the first operand) from the least-significant word. Word elements of the destination operand are updated according to the writemask. Bits (MAXVL-1:128/64/32) of the register destination
are zeroed.

EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.
