Description ¶

Invalidates mappings in the translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) and paging-structure caches that were derived from extended page tables (EPT). (See Chapter 29, “VMX Support for Address Translation.”) Invalidation is based on the INVEPT type specified in
the register operand and the INVEPT descriptor specified in the memory operand.

Outside IA-32e mode, the register operand is always 32 bits, regardless of the value of CS.D; in 64-bit mode, the register operand has 64 bits (the instruction cannot be executed in compatibility mode).

The INVEPT types supported by a logical processors are reported in the IA32_VMX_EPT_VPID_CAP MSR (see Appendix A, “VMX Capability Reporting Facility”). There are two INVEPT types currently defined:

  • Single-context invalidation. If the INVEPT type is 1, the logical processor invalidates all mappings associated with bits 51:12 of the EPT pointer (EPTP) specified in the INVEPT descriptor. It may invalidate other mappings as well.
  • Global invalidation: If the INVEPT type is 2, the logical processor invalidates mappings associated with all EPTPs.

If an unsupported INVEPT type is specified, the instruction fails.

INVEPT invalidates all the specified mappings for the indicated EPTP(s) regardless of the VPID and PCID values with which those mappings may be associated.

The INVEPT descriptor comprises 128 bits and contains a 64-bit EPTP value in bits 63:0 (see Figure 31-1).
