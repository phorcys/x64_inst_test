Description ¶

Converts packed signed doubleword integers in the first and second source operands into packed unsigned word integers using unsigned saturation to handle overflow conditions. If the signed doubleword value is beyond the range of an unsigned word (that
is, greater than FFFFH or less than 0000H), the saturated unsigned word integer value of FFFFH or 0000H, respectively, is stored in the destination.

EVEX encoded versions: The first source operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register. The second source operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register, a 512/256/128-bit memory location, or a 512/256/128-bit vector broadcasted from a 32-bit memory location. The destination
operand is a ZMM register, updated conditionally under the writemask k1.

VEX.256 encoded version: The first source operand is a YMM register. The second source operand is a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. The destination operand is a YMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:256) of the corresponding ZMM register
destination are zeroed.

VEX.128 encoded version: The first source operand is an XMM register. The second source operand is an XMM register or 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding ZMM register
destination are zeroed.

128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source operand is an XMM register. The second operand can be an XMM register or an 128-bit memory location. The destination is not distinct from the first source XMM register and the upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the
corresponding destination register destination are unmodified.
