EINCVIRTCHILD — Increment VIRTCHILDCNT in SECS

      Opcode/Instruction       Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                         Description
EAX = 01H ENCLV[EINCVIRTCHILD] IR    V/V                    EAX[5]             This leaf function increments the SECS VIRTCHILDCNT field.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En EAX                                        RBX                              RCX
IR    EINCVIRTCHILD (In) Return error code (Out) Address of an enclave page (In)  Address of an SECS page (In)

Description ¶

This instruction increments the SECS VIRTCHILDCNT field. This instruction can only be executed when the current privilege level is 0.

The content of RCX is an effective address of an EPC page. The DS segment is used to create a linear address. Segment override is not supported.

EINCVIRTCHILD Memory Parameter Semantics ¶

EPCPAGE                                     SECS
Read/Write access permitted by Non Enclave  Read access permitted by Enclave

The instruction faults if any of the following:

EINCVIRTCHILD Faulting Conditions ¶

A memory operand effective address is outside the DS segment limit (32b mode).  A page fault occurs in accessing memory operands.
DS segment is unusable (32b mode).                                              RBX does not refer to an enclave page (REG, TCS, TRIM, SECS).
A memory address is in a non-canonical form (64b mode).                         RCX does not refer to an SECS page.
A memory operand is not properly aligned.                                       RBX does not refer to an enclave page associated with SECS referenced in RCX.
