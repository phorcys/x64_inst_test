Description ¶

Load integer data from the source operand (the second operand) and broadcast to all elements of the destination operand (the first operand).

VEX256-encoded VPBROADCASTB/W/D/Q: The source operand is 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit memory location or the low 8-bit, 16-bit 32-bit, 64-bit data in an XMM register. The destination operand is a YMM register. VPBROAD-CASTI128 support the source operand
of 128-bit memory location. Register source encodings for VPBROADCAS-TI128 is reserved and will #UD. Bits (MAXVL-1:256) of the destination register are zeroed.

EVEX-encoded VPBROADCASTD/Q: The source operand is a 32-bit, 64-bit memory location or the low 32-bit, 64-bit data in an XMM register. The destination operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register and updated according to the writemask k1.

VPBROADCASTI32X4 and VPBROADCASTI64X4: The destination operand is a ZMM register and updated according to the writemask k1. The source operand is 128-bit or 256-bit memory location. Register source encodings for VBROADCASTI32X4 and VBROADCASTI64X4 are
reserved and will #UD.

Note: VEX.vvvv and EVEX.vvvv are reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.

If VPBROADCASTI128 is encoded with VEX.L= 0, an attempt to execute the instruction encoded with VEX.L= 0 will cause an #UD exception.
