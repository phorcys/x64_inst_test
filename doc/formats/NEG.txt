NEG — Two's Complement Negation

   Opcode     Instruction Op/En 64-Bit Mode Compat/Leg Mode            Description
F6 /3         NEG r/m8    M     Valid       Valid            Two's complement negate r/m8.
REX + F6 /3   NEG r/m8^1  M     Valid       N.E.             Two's complement negate r/m8.
F7 /3         NEG r/m16   M     Valid       Valid            Two's complement negate r/m16.
F7 /3         NEG r/m32   M     Valid       Valid            Two's complement negate r/m32.
REX.W + F7 /3 NEG r/m64   M     Valid       N.E.             Two's complement negate r/m64.

    1. In 64-bit mode, r/m8 can not be encoded to access the following byte registers if a REX prefix is used: AH, BH, CH, DH.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En     Operand 1     Operand 2 Operand 3 Operand 4
M     ModRM:r/m (r, w)  N/A       N/A       N/A

Description ¶

Replaces the value of operand (the destination operand) with its two's complement. (This operation is equivalent to subtracting the operand from 0.) The destination operand is located in a general-purpose register or a memory location.

This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at
the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.
