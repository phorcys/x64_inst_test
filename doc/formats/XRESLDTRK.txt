Description ¶

The instruction marks the end of an Intel TSX (RTM) suspend load address tracking region. If the instruction is used inside a suspend load address tracking region it will end the suspend region and all following load addresses will be added to the
transaction read set. If this instruction is used inside an active transaction but not in a suspend region it will cause transaction abort.

If the instruction is used outside of a transactional region it behaves like a NOP.

Chapter 16, “Programming with Intel® Transactional Synchronization Extensions‚” in the Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1 provides additional information on Intel^® TSX Suspend Load Address Tracking.
