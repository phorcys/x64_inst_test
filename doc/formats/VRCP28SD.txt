Description ¶

Computes the reciprocal approximation of the low float64 value in the second source operand (the third operand) and store the result to the destination operand (the first operand). The approximate reciprocal is evaluated with less than 2^-28 of maximum
relative error. The result is written into the low float64 element of the destination operand according to the writemask k1. Bits 127:64 of the destination is copied from the corresponding bits of the first source operand (the second operand).

A denormal input value is treated as zero and does not signal #DE, irrespective of MXCSR.DAZ. A denormal result is flushed to zero and does not signal #UE, irrespective of MXCSR.FTZ.

If any source element is NaN, the quietized NaN source value is returned for that element. If any source element is ±∞, ±0.0 is returned for that element. Also, if any source element is ±0.0, ±∞ is returned for that element.

The first source operand is an XMM register. The second source operand is an XMM register or a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is a XMM register, conditionally updated using writemask k1.
