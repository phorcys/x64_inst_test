Description ¶

This instruction calculates 2/4/8 range operation outputs from two sets of packed input double precision floating-point values in the first source operand (the second operand) and the second source operand (the third operand). The range outputs are
written to the destination operand (the first operand) under the writemask k1.

Bits7:4 of imm8 byte must be zero. The range operation output is performed in two parts, each configured by a two-bit control field within imm8[3:0]:

  • Imm8[1:0] specifies the initial comparison operation to be one of max, min, max absolute value or min absolute value of the input value pair. Each comparison of two input values produces an intermediate result that combines with the sign selection
    control (imm8[3:2]) to determine the final range operation output.
  • Imm8[3:2] specifies the sign of the range operation output to be one of the following: from the first input value, from the comparison result, set or clear.

The encodings of imm8[1:0] and imm8[3:2] are shown in Figure 5-27.

0 imm8 Must Be Zero Sign Control (SC) Compare Operation Select Imm8[1:0] = 00b : Select Min value Imm8[3:2] = 00b : Select sign(SRC1) Imm8[1:0] = 01b : Select Max value Imm8[3:2] = 01b : Select sign(Compare_Result) Imm8[1:0] = 10b : Select Min-Abs value
Imm8[3:2] = 10b : Set sign to 0 Imm8[1:0] = 11b : Select Max-Abs value Imm8[3:2] = 11b : Set sign to 1
Figure 5-27. Imm8 Controls for VRANGEPD/SD/PS/SS

When one or more of the input value is a NAN, the comparison operation may signal invalid exception (IE). Details with one of more input value is NAN is listed in Table 5-23. If the comparison raises an IE, the sign select control (imm8[3:2]) has no
effect to the range operation output; this is indicated also in Table 5-23.

When both input values are zeros of opposite signs, the comparison operation of MIN/MAX in the range compare operation is slightly different from the conceptually similar floating-point MIN/MAX operation that are found in the instructions VMAXPD/VMINPD.
The details of MIN/MAX/MIN_ABS/MAX_ABS operation for VRANGEPD/PS/SD/SS for magnitude-0, opposite-signed input cases are listed in Table 5-24.

Additionally, non-zero, equal-magnitude with opposite-sign input values perform MIN_ABS or MAX_ABS comparison operation with result listed in Table 5-25.
