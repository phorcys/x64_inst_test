VZEROUPPER — Zero Upper Bits of YMM and ZMM Registers

Description ¶

In 64-bit mode, the instruction zeroes the bits in positions 128 and higher in YMM0-YMM15 and ZMM0-ZMM15. Outside 64-bit mode, it zeroes those bits only in YMM0-YMM7 and ZMM0-ZMM7. VZEROUPPER does not modify the lower 128 bits of these registers and it
does not modify ZMM16-ZMM31.

This instruction is recommended when transitioning between AVX and legacy SSE code; it will eliminate performance penalties caused by false dependencies.

Note: VEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD. In Compatibility and legacy 32-bit mode only the lower 8 registers are modified.
