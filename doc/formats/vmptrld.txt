   Opcode/Instruction    Op/En                 Description
NP 0F C7 /6 VMPTRLD m64  M     Loads the current VMCS pointer from memory.

Description ¶

Marks the current-VMCS pointer valid and loads it with the physical address in the instruction operand. The instruction fails if its operand is not properly aligned, sets unsupported physical-address bits, or is equal to the VMXON pointer. In addition,
the instruction fails if the 32 bits in memory referenced by the operand do not match the VMCS revision identifier supported by this processor.^1

The operand of this instruction is always 64 bits and is always in memory.
