Description ¶

Multiplies the low double precision floating-point value in the second source operand by the low double precision floating-point value in the first source operand, and stores the double precision floating-point result in the destination operand. The
second source operand can be an XMM register or a 64-bit memory location. The first source operand and the destination operands are XMM registers.

128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source operand and the destination operand are the same. Bits (MAXVL-1:64) of the corresponding destination register remain unchanged.

VEX.128 and EVEX encoded version: The quadword at bits 127:64 of the destination operand is copied from the same bits of the first source operand. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the destination register are zeroed.

EVEX encoded version: The low quadword element of the destination operand is updated according to the write-mask.

Software should ensure VMULSD is encoded with VEX.L=0. Encoding VMULSD with VEX.L=1 may encounter unpredictable behavior across different processor generations.
