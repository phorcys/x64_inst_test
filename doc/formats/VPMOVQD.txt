Description ¶

VPMOVQW down converts 64-bit integer elements in the source operand (the second operand) into packed double-words using truncation. VPMOVSQW converts signed 64-bit integers into packed signed doublewords using signed saturation. VPMOVUSQW convert
unsigned quad-word values into unsigned double-word values using unsigned saturation.

The source operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register. The destination operand is a YMM/XMM/XMM register or a 256/128/64-bit memory location.

Down-converted doubleword elements are written to the destination operand (the first operand) from the least-significant doubleword. Doubleword elements of the destination operand are updated according to the writemask. Bits (MAXVL-1:256/128/64) of the
register destination are zeroed.

EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.
