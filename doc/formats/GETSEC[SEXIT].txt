GETSEC[SEXIT] — Exit Measured Environment

     Opcode        Instruction          Description
NP 0F 37 (EAX=5)  GETSEC[SEXIT] Exit measured environment.

Description ¶

The GETSEC[SEXIT] instruction initiates an exit of a measured environment established by GETSEC[SENTER]. The SEXIT leaf of GETSEC is selected with EAX set to 5 at execution. This instruction leaf sends a message to all logical processors in the platform
to signal the measured environment exit.

There are restrictions enforced by the processor for the execution of the GETSEC[SEXIT] instruction:

  • Execution is not allowed unless the processor is in protected mode (CR0.PE = 1) with CPL = 0 and EFLAGS.VM = 0.
  • The processor must be in a measured environment as launched by a previous GETSEC[SENTER] instruction, but not still in authenticated code execution mode.
  • To avoid potential interoperability conflicts between modes, the processor is not allowed to execute this instruction if it currently is in SMM or in VMX operation.
  • To ensure consistent handling of SIPI messages, the processor executing the GETSEC[SEXIT] instruction must also be designated the BSP (bootstrap processor) as defined by the register bit IA32_APIC_BASE.BSP (bit 8).

Failure to abide by the above conditions results in the processor signaling a general protection violation.

This instruction initiates a sequence to rendezvous the RLPs with the ILP. It then clears the internal processor flag indicating the processor is operating in a measured environment.

In response to a message signaling the completion of rendezvous, all RLPs restart execution with the instruction that was to be executed at the time GETSEC[SEXIT] was recognized. This applies to all processor conditions, with the following exceptions:

  • If an RLP executed HLT and was in this halt state at the time of the message initiated by GETSEC[SEXIT], then execution resumes in the halt state.
  • If an RLP was executing MWAIT, then a message initiated by GETSEC[SEXIT] causes an exit of the MWAIT state, falling through to the next instruction.
  • If an RLP was executing an intermediate iteration of a string instruction, then the processor resumes execution of the string instruction at the point which the message initiated by GETSEC[SEXIT] was recognized.
  • If an RLP is still in the SENTER sleep state (never awakened with GETSEC[WAKEUP]), it will be sent to the wait-for-SIPI state after first clearing the bootstrap processor indicator flag (IA32_APIC_BASE.BSP) and any pending SIPI state. In this case,
    such RLPs are initialized to an architectural state consistent with having taken a soft reset using the INIT# pin.

Prior to completion of the GETSEC[SEXIT] operation, both the ILP and any active RLPs unmask the response of the external event signals INIT#, A20M, NMI#, and SMI#. This unmasking is performed unconditionally to recognize pin events which are masked after
a GETSEC[SENTER]. The state of A20M is unmasked, as the A20M pin is not recognized while the measured environment is active.

On a successful exit of the measured environment, the ILP re-locks the Intel® TXT-capable chipset private configuration space. GETSEC[SEXIT] does not affect the content of any PCR.

At completion of GETSEC[SEXIT] by the ILP, execution proceeds to the next instruction. Since EFLAGS and the debug register state are not modified by this instruction, a pending trap condition is free to be signaled if previously enabled.
