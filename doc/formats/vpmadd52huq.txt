Description ¶

Multiplies packed unsigned 52-bit integers in each qword element of the first source operand (the second operand) with the packed unsigned 52-bit integers in the corresponding elements of the second source operand (the third operand) to form packed
104-bit intermediate results. The high 52-bit, unsigned integer of each 104-bit product is added to the corresponding qword unsigned integer of the destination operand (the first operand) under the writemask k1.

The first source operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register. The second source operand can be a ZMM/YMM/XMM register, a 512/256/128-bit memory location or a 512/256/128-bit vector broadcasted from a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM
register conditionally updated with writemask k1 at 64-bit granularity.
