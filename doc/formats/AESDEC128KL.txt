AESDEC128KL — Perform Ten Rounds of AES Decryption Flow With Key Locker Using 128-BitKey

              Opcode/Instruction                Op/En 64/32-bit Mode CPUID Feature Flag                                       Description
F3 0F 38 DD !(11):rrr:bbb AESDEC128KL xmm, m384 A     V/V            AESKLE             Decrypt xmm using 128-bit AES key indicated by handle at m384 and store result in xmm.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En Tuple     Operand 1       Operand 2    Operand 3 Operand 4
A     N/A   ModRM:reg (r, w)  ModRM:r/m (r)  N/A       N/A

Description ¶

The AESDEC128KL^1 instruction performs 10 rounds of AES to decrypt the first operand using the 128-bit key indicated by the handle from the second operand. It stores the result in the first operand if the operation succeeds (e.g., does not run into a
handle violation failure).
