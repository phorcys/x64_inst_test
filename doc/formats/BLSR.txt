         Opcode/Instruction          Op/En 64/32-bit Mode CPUID Feature Flag                                      Description
VEX.LZ.0F38.W0 F3 /1 BLSR r32, r/m32 VM    V/V            BMI1               Reset lowest set bit of r/m32, keep all other bits of r/m32 and write result to r32.
VEX.LZ.0F38.W1 F3 /1 BLSR r64, r/m64 VM    V/N.E.         BMI1               Reset lowest set bit of r/m64, keep all other bits of r/m64 and write result to r64.

Description ¶

Copies all bits from the source operand to the destination operand and resets (=0) the bit position in the destination operand that corresponds to the lowest set bit of the source operand. If the source operand is zero BLSR sets CF.

This instruction is not supported in real mode and virtual-8086 mode. The operand size is always 32 bits if not in 64-bit mode. In 64-bit mode operand size 64 requires VEX.W1. VEX.W1 is ignored in non-64-bit modes. An attempt to execute this instruction
with VEX.L not equal to 0 will cause #UD.
