Description ¶

Computes the approximate reciprocal of the square roots of the scalar double precision floating-point value in the low quadword element of the source operand (the second operand) and stores the result in the low quadword element of the destination
operand (the first operand) according to the writemask. The maximum relative error for this approximation is less than 2^-14. The source operand can be an XMM register or a 32-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register.

Bits (127:64) of the XMM register destination are copied from corresponding bits in the first source operand. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the destination register are zeroed.

The VRSQRT14SD instruction is not affected by the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register. When a source value is a 0.0, an ∞ with the sign of the source value is returned. When the source operand is an +∞ then +ZERO value is returned. A denormal
source value is treated as zero only if DAZ bit is set in MXCSR. Otherwise it is treated correctly and performs the approximation with the specified masked response. When a source value is a negative value (other than 0.0) a floating-point
QNaN_indefinite is returned. When a source value is an SNaN or QNaN, the SNaN is converted to a QNaN or the source QNaN is returned.

MXCSR exception flags are not affected by this instruction and floating-point exceptions are not reported.
