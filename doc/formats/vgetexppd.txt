Description ¶

Extracts the biased exponents from the normalized double precision floating-point representation of each qword data element of the source operand (the second operand) as unbiased signed integer value, or convert the denormal representation of input data
to unbiased negative integer values. Each integer value of the unbiased exponent is converted to double precision floating-point value and written to the corresponding qword elements of the destination operand (the first operand) as double precision
floating-point numbers.

The destination operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register and updated under the writemask. The source operand can be a ZMM/YMM/XMM register, a 512/256/128-bit memory location, or a 512/256/128-bit vector broadcasted from a 64-bit memory location.

EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD.

Each GETEXP operation converts the exponent value into a floating-point number (permitting input value in denormal representation). Special cases of input values are listed in Table 5-15.

The formula is:

GETEXP(x) = floor(log[2](|x|))

Notation floor(x) stands for the greatest integer not exceeding real number x.

 Input Operand           Result                                Comments
src1 = NaN       QNaN(src1)
0 < |src1| < INF floor(log[2](|src1|))  If (SRC = SNaN) then #IE If (SRC = denormal) then #DE
| src1| = +INF   +INF
| src1| = 0      -INF
