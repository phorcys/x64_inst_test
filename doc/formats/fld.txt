FLD — Load Floating-Point Value

Opcode  Instruction 64-Bit Mode Compat/Leg Mode                Description
D9 /0   FLD m32fp   Valid       Valid            Push m32fp onto the FPU register stack.
DD /0   FLD m64fp   Valid       Valid            Push m64fp onto the FPU register stack.
DB /5   FLD m80fp   Valid       Valid            Push m80fp onto the FPU register stack.
D9 C0+i FLD ST(i)   Valid       Valid            Push ST(i) onto the FPU register stack.

Description ¶

Pushes the source operand onto the FPU register stack. The source operand can be in single precision, double precision, or double extended-precision floating-point format. If the source operand is in single precision or double precision floating-point
format, it is automatically converted to the double extended-precision floating-point format before being pushed on the stack.

The FLD instruction can also push the value in a selected FPU register [ST(i)] onto the stack. Here, pushing register ST(0) duplicates the stack top.

    When the FLD instruction loads a denormal value and the DM bit in the CW is not masked, an exception is flagged but the value is still pushed onto the x87 stack.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.
