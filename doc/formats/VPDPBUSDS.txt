Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En Tuple     Operand 1       Operand 2     Operand 3   Operand 4
A     N/A   ModRM:reg (r, w)  VEX.vvvv (r)  ModRM:r/m (r) N/A
B     Full  ModRM:reg (r, w)  EVEX.vvvv (r) ModRM:r/m (r) N/A

Description ¶

Multiplies the individual unsigned bytes of the first source operand by the corresponding signed bytes of the second source operand, producing intermediate signed word results. The word results are then summed and accumulated in the destination dword
element size operand. If the intermediate sum overflows a 32b signed number the result is saturated to either 0x7FFF_FFFF for positive numbers of 0x8000_0000 for negative numbers.

This instruction supports memory fault suppression.
