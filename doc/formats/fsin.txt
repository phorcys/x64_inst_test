FSIN — Sine

Opcode  Mode Leg Mode                    Description
D9 FE                 Replace ST(0) with the approximate of its sine.

Description ¶

Computes an approximation of the sine of the source operand in register ST(0) and stores the result in ST(0). The source operand must be given in radians and must be within the range −2^63 to +2^63. The following table shows the results obtained when
taking the sine of various classes of numbers, assuming that underflow does not occur.

SRC (ST(0))  DEST (ST(0))
−∞           *
−F           − 1 to + 1
−0           −0
+0           +0
+F           − 1 to +1
+∞           *
NaN          NaN

    F Means finite floating-point value.

    * Indicatesfloating-pointinvalid-arithmetic-operand(#IA)exception.

If the source operand is outside the acceptable range, the C2 flag in the FPU status word is set, and the value in register ST(0) remains unchanged. The instruction does not raise an exception when the source operand is out of range. It is up to the
program to check the C2 flag for out-of-range conditions. Source values outside the range − 2^63 to +2^63 can be reduced to the range of the instruction by subtracting an appropriate integer multiple of 2π. However, even within the range -2^63 to +2^63,
inaccurate results can occur because the finite approximation of π used internally for argument reduction is not sufficient in all cases. Therefore, for accurate results it is safe to apply FSIN only to arguments reduced accurately in software, to a
value smaller in absolute value than 3π/4. See the sections titled “Approximation of Pi” and “Transcendental Instruction Accuracy” in Chapter 8 of the Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for a discussion of the
proper value to use for π in performing such reductions.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.
