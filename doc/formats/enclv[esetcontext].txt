ESETCONTEXT — Set the ENCLAVECONTEXT Field in SECS

     Opcode/Instruction      Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                        Description
EAX = 02H ENCLV[ESETCONTEXT] IR    V/V                    EAX[5]             This leaf function sets the ENCLAVECONTEXT field in SECS.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En EAX                                      RCX                                           RDX
IR    ESETCONTEXT (In) Return error code (Out) Address of the destination EPC page (In, EA)  Context Value (In, EA)

Description ¶

The ESETCONTEXT leaf overwrites the ENCLAVECONTEXT field in the SECS. ECREATE and ELD of an SECS set the ENCLAVECONTEXT field in the SECS to the address of the SECS (for access later in ERDINFO). The ESETCONTEXT instruction allows a VMM to overwrite the
default context value if necessary, for example, if the VMM is emulating ECREATE or ELD on behalf of the guest.

The content of RCX is an effective address of the SECS page to be updated, RDX contains the address pointing to the value to be stored in the SECS. The DS segment is used to create linear address. Segment override is not supported.

The instruction fails if:

  • The operand is not properly aligned.
  • RCX does not refer to an SECS page.

ESETCONTEXT Memory Parameter Semantics ¶

EPCPAGE                           CONTEXT
Read access permitted by Enclave  Read/Write access permitted by Non Enclave

The instruction faults if any of the following:

ESETCONTEXT Faulting Conditions ¶

A memory operand effective address is outside the DS segment limit (32b mode).  A memory operand is not properly aligned.
DS segment is unusable (32b mode).                                              A page fault occurs in accessing memory operands.
A memory address is in a non-canonical form (64b mode).
