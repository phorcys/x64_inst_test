EENTER — Enters an Enclave

Description ¶

The ENCLU[EENTER] instruction transfers execution to an enclave. At the end of the instruction, the logical processor is executing in enclave mode at the RIP computed as EnclaveBase + TCS.OENTRY. If the target address is not within the CS segment
(32-bit) or is not canonical (64-bit), a #GP(0) results.

EENTER Memory Parameter Semantics ¶

TCS
Enclave access

EENTER is a serializing instruction. The instruction faults if any of the following occurs:

Address in RBX is not properly aligned.                                        Any TCS.FLAGS’s must-be-zero bit is not zero.
TCS pointed to by RBX is not valid or available or locked.                     Current 32/64 mode does not match the enclave mode in SECS.ATTRIBUTES.MODE64.
The SECS is in use.                                                            Either of TCS-specified FS and GS segment is not a subsets of the current DS segment.
Any one of DS, ES, CS, SS is not zero.                                         If XSAVE available, CR4.OSXSAVE = 0, but SECS.ATTRIBUTES.XFRM ≠ 3.
CR4.OSFXSR ≠ 1.                                                                If CR4.OSXSAVE = 1, SECS.ATTRIBUTES.XFRM is not a subset of XCR0.
If SECS.ATTRIBUTES.AEXNOTIFY ≠ TCS.FLAGS.AEXNOTIFY and TCS.FLAGS.DBGOPTIN = 0.

The following operations are performed by EENTER:

  • RSP and RBP are saved in the current SSA frame on EENTER and are automatically restored on EEXIT or interrupt.
  • The AEP contained in RCX is stored into the TCS for use by AEXs.FS and GS (including hidden portions) are saved and new values are constructed using TCS.OFSBASE/GSBASE (32 and 64-bit mode) and TCS.OFSLIMIT/GSLIMIT (32-bit mode only). The resulting
    segments must be a subset of the DS segment.
  • If CR4.OSXSAVE == 1, XCR0 is saved and replaced by SECS.ATTRIBUTES.XFRM. The effect of RFLAGS.TF depends on whether the enclave entry is opt-in or opt-out (see Section 40.1.2):
      □ On opt-out entry, TF is saved and cleared (it is restored on EEXIT or AEX). Any attempt to set TF via a POPF instruction while inside the enclave clears TF (see Section 40.2.5).
      □ On opt-out entry, TF is saved and cleared (it is restored on EEXIT or AEX). Any attempt to set TF via a POPF instruction while inside the enclave clears TF (see Section 40.2.5).
      □ On opt-in entry, a single-step debug exception is pended on the instruction boundary immediately after EENTER (see Section 40.2.2).
      □ On opt-in entry, a single-step debug exception is pended on the instruction boundary immediately after EENTER (see Section 40.2.2).
  • All code breakpoints that do not overlap with ELRANGE are also suppressed. If the entry is an opt-out entry, all code and data breakpoints that overlap with the ELRANGE are suppressed.
  • On opt-out entry, a number of performance monitoring counters and behaviors are modified or suppressed (see Section 40.2.3):
      □ All performance monitoring activity on the current thread is suppressed except for incrementing and firing of FIXED_CTR1 and FIXED_CTR2.
      □ All performance monitoring activity on the current thread is suppressed except for incrementing and firing of FIXED_CTR1 and FIXED_CTR2.
      □ PEBS is suppressed.
      □ PEBS is suppressed.
      □ AnyThread counting on other threads is demoted to MyThread mode and IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS[60] on that thread is set
      □ AnyThread counting on other threads is demoted to MyThread mode and IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS[60] on that thread is set
      □ If the opt-out entry on a hardware thread results in suppression of any performance monitoring, then the processor sets IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS[60] and IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS[63].
      □ If the opt-out entry on a hardware thread results in suppression of any performance monitoring, then the processor sets IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS[60] and IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS[63].
