Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En     Operand 1       Operand 2     Operand 3   Operand 4
RMI   ModRM:reg (r, w)  ModRM:r/m (r) imm8          N/A
RVMI  ModRM:reg (w)     VEX.vvvv (r)  ModRM:r/m (r) imm8

Description ¶

Words from the source operand (second operand) are conditionally written to the destination operand (first operand) depending on bits in the immediate operand (third operand). The immediate bits (bits 7:0) form a mask that determines whether the
corresponding word in the destination is copied from the source. If a bit in the mask, corresponding to a word, is “1", then the word is copied, else the word element in the destination operand is unchanged.

128-bit Legacy SSE version: The second source operand can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The first source and destination operands are XMM registers. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged.

VEX.128 encoded version: The second source operand can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The first source and destination operands are XMM registers. Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding YMM register are zeroed.

VEX.256 encoded version: The first source operand is a YMM register. The second source operand is a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. The destination operand is a YMM register.
