Description ¶

The SENDUIPI instruction sends the user interprocessor interrupt (IPI) indicated by its register operand. (The operand always has 64 bits; operand-size overrides such as the prefix 66 are ignored.)

SENDUIPI uses a data structure called the user-interrupt target table (UITT). This table is located at the linear address UITTADDR (in the IA32_UINTR_TT MSR); it comprises UITTSZ+1 16-byte entries, where UITTSZ = IA32_UINT_MISC[31:0]. SENDUIPI uses the
UITT entry (UITTE) indexed by the instruction's register operand. Each UITTE has the following format:

  • Bit 0: V, a valid bit.
  • Bits 7:1 are reserved and must be 0.
  • Bits 15:8: UV, the user-interrupt vector (in the range 0–63, so bits 15:14 must be 0).
  • Bits 63:16 are reserved.
  • Bits 127:64: UPIDADDR, the linear address of a user posted-interrupt descriptor (UPID). (UPIDADDR is 64-byte aligned, so bits 69:64 of each UITTE must be 0.)

Each UPID has the following format (fields and bits not referenced are reserved):

  • Bit 0 (ON) indicates an outstanding notification. If this bit is set, there is a notification outstanding for one or more user interrupts in PIR.
  • Bit 1 (SN) indicates that notifications should be suppressed. If this bit is set, agents (including SENDUIPI) should not send notifications when posting user interrupts in this descriptor.
  • Bits 23:16 (NV) contain the notification vector. This is used by agents sending user-interrupt notifications (including SENDUIPI).
  • Bits 63:32 (NDST) contain the notification destination. This is the target physical APIC ID (in xAPIC mode, bits 47:40 are the 8-bit APIC ID; in x2APIC mode, the entire field forms the 32-bit APIC ID).
  • Bits 127:64 (PIF) contain posted-interrupt requests. There is one bit for each user-interrupt vector. There is a user-interrupt request for a vector if the corresponding bit is 1.

Although SENDUIPI may be executed at any privilege level, all of the instruction’s memory accesses (to a UITTE and a UPID) are performed with supervisor privilege.

SENDUIPI sends a user interrupt by posting a user interrupt with vector V in the UPID referenced by UPIDADDR and then sending, as an ordinary IPI, any notification interrupt specified in that UPID.
