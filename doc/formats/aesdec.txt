Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Description ¶

This instruction performs a single round of the AES decryption flow using the Equivalent Inverse Cipher, using one/two/four (depending on vector length) 128-bit data (state) from the first source operand with one/two/four (depending on vector length)
round key(s) from the second source operand, and stores the result in the destination operand.

Use the AESDEC instruction for all but the last decryption round. For the last decryption round, use the AESDECLAST instruction.

VEX and EVEX encoded versions of the instruction allow 3-operand (non-destructive) operation. The legacy encoded versions of the instruction require that the first source operand and the destination operand are the same and must be an XMM register.

The EVEX encoded form of this instruction does not support memory fault suppression.
