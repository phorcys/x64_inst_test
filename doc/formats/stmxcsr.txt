Description ¶

Stores the contents of the MXCSR control and status register to the destination operand. The destination operand is a 32-bit memory location. The reserved bits in the MXCSR register are stored as 0s.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.

VEX.L must be 0, otherwise instructions will #UD.

Note: In VEX-encoded versions, VEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD.
