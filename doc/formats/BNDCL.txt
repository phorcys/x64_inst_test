BNDCL — Check Lower Bound

     Opcode/Instruction      Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                                   Description
F3 0F 1A /r BNDCL bnd, r/m32 RM    N.E./V                 MPX                Generate a #BR if the address in r/m32 is lower than the lower bound in bnd.LB.
F3 0F 1A /r BNDCL bnd, r/m64 RM    V/N.E.                 MPX                Generate a #BR if the address in r/m64 is lower than the lower bound in bnd.LB.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En   Operand 1      Operand 2    Operand 3
RM    ModRM:reg (w)  ModRM:r/m (r)  N/A

Description ¶

Compare the address in the second operand with the lower bound in bnd. The second operand can be either a register or memory operand. If the address is lower than the lower bound in bnd.LB, it will set BNDSTATUS to 01H and signal a #BR exception.

This instruction does not cause any memory access, and does not read or write any flags.
