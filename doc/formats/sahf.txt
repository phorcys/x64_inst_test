Description ¶

Loads the SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF flags of the EFLAGS register with values from the corresponding bits in the AH register (bits 7, 6, 4, 2, and 0, respectively). Bits 1, 3, and 5 of register AH are ignored; the corresponding reserved bits (1, 3, and 5) in
the EFLAGS register remain as shown in the “Operation” section below.

This instruction executes as described above in compatibility mode and legacy mode. It is valid in 64-bit mode only if CPUID.80000001H:ECX.LAHF-SAHF[bit 0] = 1.
