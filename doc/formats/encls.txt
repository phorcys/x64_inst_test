Description ¶

The ENCLS instruction invokes the specified privileged Intel SGX leaf function for managing and debugging enclaves. Software specifies the leaf function by setting the appropriate value in the register EAX as input. The registers RBX, RCX, and RDX have
leaf-specific purpose, and may act as input, as output, or may be unused. In 64-bit mode, the instruction ignores upper 32 bits of the RAX register.

The ENCLS instruction produces an invalid-opcode exception (#UD) if CR0.PE = 0 or RFLAGS.VM = 1, or if it is executed in system-management mode (SMM). Additionally, any attempt to execute the instruction when CPL > 0 results in #UD. The instruction
produces a general-protection exception (#GP) if CR0.PG = 0 or if an attempt is made to invoke an undefined leaf function.

In VMX non-root operation, execution of ENCLS may cause a VM exit if the “enable ENCLS exiting” VM-execution control is 1. In this case, execution of individual leaf functions of ENCLS is governed by the ENCLS-exiting bitmap field in the VMCS. Each bit
in that field corresponds to the index of an ENCLS leaf function (as provided in EAX).

Software in VMX root operation can thus intercept the invocation of various ENCLS leaf functions in VMX non-root operation by setting the “enable ENCLS exiting” VM-execution control and setting the corresponding bits in the ENCLS-exiting bitmap.

Addresses and operands are 32 bits outside 64-bit mode (IA32_EFER.LMA = 0 || CS.L = 0) and are 64 bits in 64-bit mode (IA32_EFER.LMA = 1 || CS.L = 1). CS.D value has no impact on address calculation. The DS segment is used to create linear addresses.

Segment override prefixes and address-size override prefixes are ignored, and is the REX prefix in 64-bit mode.
