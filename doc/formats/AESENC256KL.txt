AESENC256KL — Perform 14 Rounds of AES Encryption Flow With Key Locker Using 256-Bit Key

              Opcode/Instruction                Op/En 64/32-bit Mode CPUID Feature Flag                                       Description
F3 0F 38 DE !(11):rrr:bbb AESENC256KL xmm, m512 A     V/V            AESKLE             Encrypt xmm using 256-bit AES key indicated by handle at m512 and store result in xmm.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Description ¶

The AESENC256KL^1 instruction performs 14 rounds of AES to encrypt the first operand using the 256-bit key indicated by the handle from the second operand. It stores the result in the first operand if the operation succeeds (e.g., does not run into a
handle violation failure).
