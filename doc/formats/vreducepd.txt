Description ¶

Perform reduction transformation of the packed binary encoded double precision floating-point values in the source operand (the second operand) and store the reduced results in binary floating-point format to the destination operand (the first operand)
under the writemask k1.

The reduction transformation subtracts the integer part and the leading M fractional bits from the binary floating-point source value, where M is a unsigned integer specified by imm8[7:4], see Figure 5-28. Specifically, the reduction transformation can
be expressed as:

dest = src – (ROUND(2^M*src))*2^-M;

where “Round()” treats “src”, “2^M”, and their product as binary floating-point numbers with normalized significand and biased exponents.

The magnitude of the reduced result can be expressed by considering src= 2^p*man2,

where ‘man2’ is the normalized significand and ‘p’ is the unbiased exponent

Then if RC = RNE: 0<=|Reduced Result|<=2^p-M-1

Then if RC ≠ RNE: 0<=|Reduced Result|<2^p-M

This instruction might end up with a precision exception set. However, in case of SPE set (i.e., Suppress Precision Exception, which is imm8[3]=1), no precision exception is reported.

EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.
