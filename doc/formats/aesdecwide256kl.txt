AESDECWIDE256KL — Perform 14 Rounds of AES Decryption Flow With Key Locker on 8 BlocksUsing 256-Bit Key

                   Opcode/Instruction                    Op/En 64/32-bit Mode CPUID Feature Flag                                                             Description

Description ¶

The AESDECWIDE256KL^1 instruction performs 14 rounds of AES to decrypt each of the eight blocks in XMM0-7 using the 256-bit key indicated by the handle from the second operand. It replaces each input block in XMM0-7 with its corresponding decrypted block
if the operation succeeds (e.g., does not run into a handle violation failure).
