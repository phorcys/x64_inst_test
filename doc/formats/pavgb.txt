Description ¶

Performs a SIMD average of the packed unsigned integers from the source operand (second operand) and the destination operand (first operand), and stores the results in the destination operand. For each corresponding pair of data elements in the first and
second operands, the elements are added together, a 1 is added to the temporary sum, and that result is shifted right one bit position.

The (V)PAVGB instruction operates on packed unsigned bytes and the (V)PAVGW instruction operates on packed unsigned words.

In 64-bit mode and not encoded with VEX/EVEX, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).

Legacy SSE instructions: The source operand can be an MMX technology register or a 64-bit memory location. The destination operand can be an MMX technology register.

128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source operand is an XMM register. The second operand can be an XMM register or an 128-bit memory location. The destination is not distinct from the first source XMM register and the upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the
corresponding register destination are unmodified.

EVEX.512 encoded version: The first source operand is a ZMM register. The second source operand is a ZMM register or a 512-bit memory location. The destination operand is a ZMM register.

VEX.256 and EVEX.256 encoded versions: The first source operand is a YMM register. The second source operand is a YMM register or a 256-bit memory location. The destination operand is a YMM register.

VEX.128 and EVEX.128 encoded versions: The first source operand is an XMM register. The second source operand is an XMM register or 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding
register destination are zeroed.
