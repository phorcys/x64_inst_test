FINCSTP — Increment Stack-Top Pointer

Opcode  Mode Leg Mode                      Description
D9 F7                 Increment the TOP field in the FPU status register.

Description ¶

Adds one to the TOP field of the FPU status word (increments the top-of-stack pointer). If the TOP field contains a 7, it is set to 0. The effect of this instruction is to rotate the stack by one position. The contents of the FPU data registers and tag
register are not affected. This operation is not equivalent to popping the stack, because the tag for the previous top-of-stack register is not marked empty.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.
