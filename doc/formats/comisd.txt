Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En   Tuple Type     Operand 1      Operand 2    Operand 3 Operand 4
A     N/A            ModRM:reg (w)  ModRM:r/m (r)  N/A       N/A
B     Tuple1 Scalar  ModRM:reg (w)  ModRM:r/m (r)  N/A       N/A

Description ¶

Compares the double precision floating-point values in the low quadwords of operand 1 (first operand) and operand 2 (second operand), and sets the ZF, PF, and CF flags in the EFLAGS register according to the result (unordered, greater than, less than, or
equal). The OF, SF, and AF flags in the EFLAGS register are set to 0. The unordered result is returned if either source operand is a NaN (QNaN or SNaN).

Operand 1 is an XMM register; operand 2 can be an XMM register or a 64 bit memory location. The COMISD instruction differs from the UCOMISD instruction in that it signals a SIMD floating-point invalid operation exception (#I) when a source operand is
either a QNaN or SNaN. The UCOMISD instruction signals an invalid operation exception only if a source operand is an SNaN.

The EFLAGS register is not updated if an unmasked SIMD floating-point exception is generated.

VEX.vvvv and EVEX.vvvv are reserved and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD.

Software should ensure VCOMISD is encoded with VEX.L=0. Encoding VCOMISD with VEX.L=1 may encounter unpredictable behavior across different processor generations.
