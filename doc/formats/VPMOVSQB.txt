Description ¶

VPMOVQB down converts 64-bit integer elements in the source operand (the second operand) into packed byte elements using truncation. VPMOVSQB converts signed 64-bit integers into packed signed bytes using signed saturation. VPMOVUSQB convert unsigned
quad-word values into unsigned byte values using unsigned saturation. The source operand is a vector register. The destination operand is an XMM register or a memory location.

Down-converted byte elements are written to the destination operand (the first operand) from the least-significant byte. Byte elements of the destination operand are updated according to the writemask. Bits (MAXVL-1:64) of the destination are zeroed.

EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.
