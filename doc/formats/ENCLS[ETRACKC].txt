ETRACKC — Activates EBLOCK Checks

   Opcode/Instruction    Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                 Description
EAX = 11H ENCLS[ETRACKC] IR    V/V                    EAX[6]             This leaf function activates EBLOCK checks.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En EAX                                 RCX
IR    ETRACK (In) Return error code (Out) Address of the destination EPC page (In, EA)  Address of the SECS page (In, EA)

Description ¶

The ETRACKC instruction is thread safe variant of ETRACK leaf and can be executed concurrently with other CPU threads operating on the same SECS.

This leaf function provides the mechanism for hardware to track that software has completed the required TLB address clears successfully. The instruction can only be executed when the current privilege level is 0.

The content of RCX is an effective address of an EPC page.

The table below provides additional information on the memory parameter of ETRACK leaf function.

SGX_EPC_PAGE_CONFLICT   7     Failure due to concurrent operation of another SGX instruction.
SGX_PG_INVLD            6     Target page is not a VALID EPC page.
SGX_PREV_TRK_INCMPL     17    All processors did not complete the previous tracking sequence.
SGX_TRACK_NOT_REQUIRED  27    Target page type does not require tracking.
