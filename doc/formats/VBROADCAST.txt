Description ¶

VBROADCASTSD/VBROADCASTSS/VBROADCASTF128 load floating-point values as one tuple from the source operand (second operand) in memory and broadcast to all elements of the destination operand (first operand).

VEX256-encoded versions: The destination operand is a YMM register. The source operand is either a 32-bit, 64-bit, or 128-bit memory location. Register source encodings are reserved and will #UD. Bits (MAXVL-1:256) of the destination register are zeroed.

EVEX-encoded versions: The destination operand is a ZMM/YMM/XMM register and updated according to the writemask k1. The source operand is either a 32-bit, 64-bit memory location or the low doubleword/quadword element of an XMM register.

VBROADCASTF32X2/VBROADCASTF32X4/VBROADCASTF64X2/VBROADCASTF32X8/VBROADCASTF64X4 load floating-point values as tuples from the source operand (the second operand) in memory or register and broadcast to all elements of the destination operand (the first
operand). The destination operand is a YMM/ZMM register updated according to the writemask k1. The source operand is either a register or 64-bit/128-bit/256-bit memory location.

VBROADCASTSD and VBROADCASTF128,F32x4 and F64x2 are only supported as 256-bit and 512-bit wide versions and up. VBROADCASTSS is supported in 128-bit, 256-bit and 512-bit wide versions. F32x8 and F64x4 are only supported as 512-bit wide versions.

VBROADCASTF32X2/VBROADCASTF32X4/VBROADCASTF32X8 have 32-bit granularity. VBROADCASTF64X2 and VBROADCASTF64X4 have 64-bit granularity.

Note: VEX.vvvv and EVEX.vvvv are reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.

If VBROADCASTSD or VBROADCASTF128 is encoded with VEX.L= 0, an attempt to execute the instruction encoded with VEX.L= 0 will cause an #UD exception.
