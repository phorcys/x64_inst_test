Description ¶

Computes the reciprocal approximation of the float32 values in the source operand (the second operand) and store the results to the destination operand (the first operand) using the writemask k1. The approximate reciprocal is evaluated with less than 2^
-28 of maximum relative error prior to final rounding. The final results are rounded to < 2^-23 relative error before written to the destination.

Denormal input values are treated as zeros and do not signal #DE, irrespective of MXCSR.DAZ. Denormal results are flushed to zeros and do not signal #UE, irrespective of MXCSR.FTZ.

If any source element is NaN, the quietized NaN source value is returned for that element. If any source element is ±∞, ±0.0 is returned for that element. Also, if any source element is ±0.0, ±∞ is returned for that element.

The source operand is a ZMM register, a 512-bit memory location, or a 512-bit vector broadcasted from a 32-bit memory location. The destination operand is a ZMM register, conditionally updated using writemask k1.

EVEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.
