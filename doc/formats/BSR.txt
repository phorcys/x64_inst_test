Description ¶

Searches the source operand (second operand) for the most significant set bit (1 bit). If a most significant 1 bit is found, its bit index is stored in the destination operand (first operand). The source operand can be a register or a memory location;
the destination operand is a register. The bit index is an unsigned offset from bit 0 of the source operand. If the content source operand is 0, the content of the destination operand is undefined.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at
the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.
