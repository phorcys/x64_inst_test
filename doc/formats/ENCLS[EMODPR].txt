EMODPR — Restrict the Permissions of an EPC Page

  Opcode/Instruction    Op/En 64/32 bit Mode Support CPUID Feature Flag                                              Description
EAX = 0EH ENCLS[EMODPR] IR    V/V                    SGX2               This leaf function restricts the access rights associated with a EPC page in an initialized enclave.

Instruction Operand Encoding ¶

Op/En EAX                                 RBX                       RCX
IR    EMODPR (In) Return Error Code (Out) Address of a SECINFO (In) Address of the destination EPC page (In)

Description ¶

This leaf function restricts the access rights associated with an EPC page in an initialized enclave. THE RWX bits of the SECINFO parameter are treated as a permissions mask; supplying a value that does not restrict the page permissions will have no
effect. This instruction can only be executed when current privilege level is 0.

RBX contains the effective address of a SECINFO structure while RCX contains the effective address of an EPC page. The table below provides additional information on the memory parameter of the EMODPR leaf function.

EMODPR Memory Parameter Semantics ¶

SECINFO                               EPCPAGE
Read access permitted by Non Enclave  Read/Write access permitted by Enclave

The instruction faults if any of the following:

EMODPR Faulting Conditions ¶

The operands are not properly aligned.    If unsupported security attributes are set.
The Enclave is not initialized.           SECS is locked by another thread.
The EPC page is locked by another thread. RCX does not contain an effective address of an EPC page in the running enclave.
The EPC page is not valid.

The error codes are:

Error Code (see Table 38-4)                                   Description
No Error                    EMODPR successful.
SGX_PAGE_NOT_MODIFIABLE     The EPC page cannot be modified because it is in the PENDING or MODIFIED state.
SGX_EPC_PAGE_CONFLICT       Page is being written by EADD, EAUG, ECREATE, ELDU/B, EMODT, or EWB.
