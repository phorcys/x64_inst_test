Description ¶

Adjusts the sum of two packed BCD values to create a packed BCD result. The AL register is the implied source and destination operand. The DAA instruction is only useful when it follows an ADD instruction that adds (binary addition) two 2-digit, packed
BCD values and stores a byte result in the AL register. The DAA instruction then adjusts the contents of the AL register to contain the correct 2-digit, packed BCD result. If a decimal carry is detected, the CF and AF flags are set accordingly.

This instruction executes as described above in compatibility mode and legacy mode. It is not valid in 64-bit mode.
