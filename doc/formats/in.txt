Description ¶

Copies the value from the I/O port specified with the second operand (source operand) to the destination operand (first operand). The source operand can be a byte-immediate or the DX register; the destination operand can be register AL, AX, or EAX,
depending on the size of the port being accessed (8, 16, or 32 bits, respectively). Using the DX register as a source operand allows I/O port addresses from 0 to 65,535 to be accessed; using a byte immediate allows I/O port addresses 0 to 255 to be
accessed.

When accessing an 8-bit I/O port, the opcode determines the port size; when accessing a 16- and 32-bit I/O port, the operand-size attribute determines the port size. At the machine code level, I/O instructions are shorter when accessing 8-bit I/O ports.
Here, the upper eight bits of the port address will be 0.

This instruction is only useful for accessing I/O ports located in the processor’s I/O address space. See Chapter 19, “Input/Output,” in the Intel^® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for more information on accessing I/O
ports in the I/O address space.

This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.
